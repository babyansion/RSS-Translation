src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/04/HBR-Article-1200x675-1.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;如果有一个真理在中心现代营销，就是这个：品牌不再拥有叙事权。消费者会这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;品牌认知一旦围绕董事会制定，现在就掌握在消费者手中，因为他们转向数字空间来分享他们的意见、建议和需求。反过来，定义品牌的叙事是通过消费者与彼此的对话而产生的，并逐秒演变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在消费者最信任他们的同龄人提供建议和建议的时代，最好的投资主管之一可以做的是更好地了解消费者。这就是洞察力驱动营销进入战略图景的地方，将消费者的需求放在首位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;洞察力驱动营销的需求&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;消费者洞察力基于从调查和民意调查等耗时过程中收集的静态数据，这些数据曾经很少见。随着每天有数十亿条新帖子通过互联网上传，组织有无数机会更好地了解他们的客户。但几乎在一夜之间，品牌已经被数字资源淹没，无法获得更动态的洞察力。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/ &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Forrester Consulting&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了保持竞争力和相关性，企业需要先进的手段来与所有渠道和市场的消费者对话保持同步。这就是洞察力驱动的营销如此重要的原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;使用人工智能、高级数据结构和其他技术推进功能，洞察力驱动的营销在混乱中揭示方向。它可以让高管更深入地了解什么对他们的受众真正重要，然后可以为他们的业务决策提供信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; >;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong >;人工智能在洞察力驱动的营销中的关键作用&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，下一代人工智能和大型语言模型简化了从数据噪音到可操作洞察力的过程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自然语言处理和视觉分析为营销人员提供了实时理解品牌叙述和感知的先进工具。模式检测算法和数字“助手”等 AI 支持的工具也在丰富营销人员的情境智能，使他们能够更好地预测接下来会发生什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着 AI 继续快速发展，没有比这更好的了是组织采用技术前沿解决方案的时候了。有了它们，品牌就可以通过趋势发现、病毒式内容预测和预测活动投资回报等能力来确保其运营不会过时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;企业级挑战的解决方案&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;洞察力驱动的营销的好处与业务增长并行。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing -and-sales/our-insights/the-new-marketing-model-for-growth-how-cpgs-can-crack-the-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;McKinsey &amp;amp;公司&lt;/a>;。不过，随着好处的增加，责任也随之增加，关键信息被泄露的机会也增加了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;洞察力驱动的营销解决方案让高管能够全面了解其业务关键要素的消费者数据集，包括市场营销、公共关系、战略和研发。但是，如果没有系统和团队来分析这些信息并将其提供给关键利益相关者和决策者，所有这些信息都将失去其潜在效用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于需要考虑如此多的潜在知识流失点，大型企业需要量身定制的解决方案成功的洞察力驱动的营销。但只有那些将技术前沿工具与优质服务相结合的解决方案才能满足企业级需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;如果 (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;真实世界的结果&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多行业领先的品牌已经通过大规模应用以洞察力为导向的营销并取得了变革性的成果，从而赢得了市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自 2016 年以来，&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.meltwater.com/en/customer-stories/shiseido?utm_source=paid-3rd-party&amp;amp;utm_medium=hbr&amp;amp;utm_campaign=paid-3rd-party-hbr&amp;amp;utm_content=customer-story- demo-request&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Shiseido&lt;/a>; 使用一套企业级解决方案来巩固和优化其国际多品牌社交媒体运营。将 200 多名用户聚集到一个具有统一数据集和自定义分析仪表板的套件中，为资生堂提供了关于其客户需求和看法的单一真实来源。 “我们能够创建一个全球一致的 KPI 框架，然后从营销目标回报一直转变为将其与投资回报联系起来，”资生堂全球分析主管高级副总裁 Amit Naik 说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meltwater.com/en/customer-stories/haleon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Haleon&lt;/a>; 使用企业级社交智能解决方案来管理其超过 25 个自有品牌的产品组合，这些品牌在 170 个市场均有销售。 “今天，我们的品牌更具竞争力，因为我们为他们提供了业内其他人无法提供的洞察力，”Haleon 社交情报负责人丹尼加德纳说。 “而且我们做得很快。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;借助全球统一的社交智能，以洞察力为导向的营销的好处遍及品牌和团队。因此，即使 Haleon 的牙科部门销售团队的消费者研究效率提高了 80%，其软膏品牌之一的社交媒体团队也利用洞察力同时推动了 272% 的参与度同比增长。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;展望未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为当今品牌管理中最强大的力量，消费者对话可以为每个组织层面的业务决策提供信息。只有洞察力驱动的营销才能让组织大规模地关注客户的声音。随着其核心技术的进步，品牌将获得越来越多的机会来了解他们的消费者。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;总结。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;最近一项针对 CEO 的调查表明，大多数人预计美国会出现衰退，但它会“短暂而浅薄”。 8221；出于这个原因，许多人预计不会裁员，有些甚至仍在招聘。它表明当前紧张的劳动力市场将继续存在，即使经济因美联储加息和持续的银行业动荡而降温。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ceos-are-predicting-a-mild-recession-in-the-us?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a >; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ceos-are-predicting-a-mild-recession-in-the-us?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p >;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;首席执行官们继续就美国经济发出相同的信息：经济衰退迫在眉睫，但劳动力市场的持续强势将持续下去。通常，在这种不确定的时期，企业高管会专注于削减成本和裁员，但他们反而预计就业市场将保持竞争。看似认知失调的背后是一个经济体的复杂性，该经济体近年来遭受了一系列冲击——从大流行病到通货膨胀，再到快速加息，再到小型银行业危机——但仍继续散发出韧性迹象。&lt;/span>;&lt; span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://www.conference-board.org/topics/CEO-Confidence&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Conference Boar 发布的 CEO 信心指标&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none &quot;>;d&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;，我是首席经济学家，&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;显示连续第四个季度世界顶级管理人员绝大多数预计美国将在未来 12 至 18 个月内陷入衰退。但他们预计这将是短暂而浅薄的，全球溢出效应有限。根据该调查的第二季度迭代，超过 87% 的 CEO 预见了这种情况，而只有 6% 的人预计会出现严重的衰退并产生全球溢出效应，只有 7% 的人预计根本不会出现衰退。首席执行官们普遍的悲观情绪继续影响整体信心指数，该指数为 43，比大流行最严重时期的低点好不了多少。 （会议委员会对 CEO 信心的衡量是与商业委员会合作对近 150 位 CEO 进行的季度调查。受访者是商业委员会的成员，低于 50 的读数反映出对调查的消极反应多于积极反应。）&lt;/span >;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;跨度数据-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;在过去的季度调查中，首席执行官们表示，他们预计美联储的反通胀努力将推动美国经济短暂而温和的下滑。首席执行官们继续表示，他们支持央行本季度积极加息，即使在经济衰退和持续银行业危机的明确预期下也是如此。事实上，82% 的首席执行官认为通货膨胀应该是美联储货币政策决定的驱动力。首席执行官们认为对美联储政策的其他影响远不那么重要，包括劳动力市场紧张 (49%)、银行业压力和信贷紧缩的可能性 (43%)、GDP 增长 (28%) 和债务上限不确定性 (1 %)。鉴于消费者通胀的常用指标远高于美联储 2% 的目标，而且通胀预期升高的风险已根深蒂固，这种观点是有道理的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;首席执行官们似乎对挥之不去的银行业危机泰然处之，而且基本上不认为它有可能引发严重衰退，甚至根本不会助长衰退。在调查中被问及对危机的不同反应时，只有 28% 的首席执行官表示他们正在增加自己公司的流动性，只有 17% 的首席执行官正在改变银行关系。大多数 CEO 正在“审视关系”，而不是采取严厉措施来保护自己免受危机残余影响：62% 的 CEO 正在审视与银行的关系，28% 正在审视自己的风险管理，33% 正在审视客户的流动性充足性, 30% 正在检查其供应商的流动性是否充足。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;尽管美国经济前景黯淡，但首席执行官们仍然相信劳动力市场将出乎意料，并在很大程度上保持稳定。三组调查回复支持这一结论：首先，只有 20% 的 CEO 打算在未来 12 个月内裁员。令人惊讶的是，33% 的人预计会继续招聘，而相当大的 46% 的人预计人员配置不会发生变化。其次，75% 的 CEO 计划在明年将工资提高 3 个百分点或更多，另有 20% 的 CEO 计划同期将工资提高 1-3 个百分点。与此同时，总共只有 5% 的人预计工资不会发生变化 (4%) 或打算削减工资 (1%)。第三，也是最后一点，只有 9% 的 CEO 预计在招聘合格员工方面没有困难，这意味着 91% 的 CEO 预计会有一些困难或困难很大。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot; 335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259 }&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;劳动力短缺是今天的前景与之前的低迷时期的主要区别。此外，劳动力短缺是首席执行官们预计衰退将“短暂而浅薄”的原因。工人流失、严格的移民政策，以及最关键的劳动力老龄化，正在造成工人供应严重短缺，尽管今年某些行业的需求可能会下降。虽然 25 至 64 岁的工人在大流行后大部分重返劳动力市场，但 65 岁及以上的工人正在迅速退出，导致缺乏具备技能和经验的员工。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot; {&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;这个背景使CEO 的回答更容易理解，CEO 属于三个阵营之一。在第一个阵营中，很大一部分 CEO 仍在招聘员工来填补因婴儿潮一代退休而空缺的职位。这些职位在需要面对面工作的行业中最为普遍，包括医疗保健、儿童和老人护理、酒店、餐馆和旅游。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;第二个是五分之一的公司发出裁员信号。随着对商品、技术、金融和住房的需求激增，这些可能是在健康危机期间表现出色的流行病宠儿。在利率上升和消费者将需求转向服务的情况下，它们被迫调整规模。这些不幸的领域包括科技行业、金融、房地产、建筑、运输和仓储等广泛领域。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot; ;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;大多数 CEO 属于第三阵营他们的劳动力，因为他们预计会出现短暂而轻微的衰退，并且宁愿囤积劳动力而不是释放工人并以可能更高的成本重新雇用他们。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot; ;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;CEO 的这种行为凸显了公司的困难即使在凝视另一场衰退的深渊时，也面临着维持熟练劳动力的问题。尽管与一年前相比，他们面临的困难有所减轻，但大多数公司仍预计至少在招聘有才能的员工时会遇到一些困难。此外，为了吸引和留住人才，首席执行官们继续将砸钱（以提高工资和福利的形式）视为解决这一长期问题的主要方法。由于无限期地提高工资和福利是不可持续的，许多公司正在转向自动化和数字化转型，以填补因工人供应受限而造成的缺口。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0, &amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;CEO们对经济衰退和劳工的看法也是如此力有意义吗？&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;是的。消费者也担心未来六个月内会出现衰退，但根据 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence&quot;>;&lt; span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;The Conference Board 消费者信心调查&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;。此外，&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;大型企业联合会美国领先经济指数&lt; /span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>; 一年多以来，美国经济开始衰退的迹象已经持续了一年多，但由于强劲的劳动力市场组成部分，当前经济指数依然强劲。尽管通货膨胀率居高不下，但就连美联储今年开始降息的金融市场定价也表明投资者预期经济衰退。尽管如此，预计的宽松政策相对较小，表明劳动力市场持续的劳动力短缺相关紧缩导致了短暂而轻微的衰退。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0, &amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;找到正确的平衡点——来自企业观点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;董事会需要深入了解企业面临的主要风险，并且应该能够量化其潜在影响。然后可以权衡有关成本投资的决策与&lt;em>;不&lt;/em>;采取行动的潜在成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过使网络风险管理与业务需求保持一致，组织可以建立符合定义的风险偏好。这个过程需要鼓励 CISO、首席技术官和首席信息官职能之间的协作，他们都应该参与分析每个网络场景。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过这种方法，董事会可以要求看到真实的情况降低风险。与此同时，安全领导者可以通过帮助业务部门降低业务影响风险来在业务部门内建立盟友。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;绘制“皇冠上的宝石”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;网络风险管理的第一步是确定归宿的优先顺序。组织可以利用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot;>;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a>; 等行业框架来提供洞察力通过整合的威胁可见性进入盲点。 MITRE 为安全运营团队开发和制定检测规则框架提供了基础，这些规则特定于组织的独特威胁和漏洞。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像 MITRE 这样的框架可以&lt;a href= “https://blog.cyberproof.com/blog/creating-a-smarter-soc-with-the-mitre-attck-framework”>;通过查看行业、地理位置等参数来改善威胁覆盖范围和响应&lt;/a>;，和领导。借助 MITRE，组织可以确定哪些威胁以及技术领域的哪些方面最有可能导致损害。通过使用 MITRE 规划关键业务资产，可以制定降低业务风险的定制计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;降低成本&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;鉴于宏观经济的影响在经济低迷时期，许多高管面临的最大问题是如何利用更有限的资源维持有效的网络安全。这就是自动化和人工智能 (AI) 的用武之地，因为它们有可能降低降低风险的费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据 IBM 的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/ reports/data-breach&quot;>;2022 年数据泄露成本&lt;/a>;，部署人工智能和自动化的组织平均减少了 300 万美元的泄露成本。 AI 是他们最大的成本节省；那些部署人工智能和自动化的人更快地检测到违规行为，从而最大限度地减少对运营的影响。另一种削减成本的策略涉及先进的云解决方案，可显着节省数据摄取和存储成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;从获得合适的人才开始&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;拉动所有为此，组织需要配备合适的人才。但这说起来容易做起来难。简而言之：网络安全工作的数量多于可用专业人员的数量。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2022-WorkForce-Study/ISC2-Cyber​​security-Workforce-Study.ashx&quot;>;根据 (ISC)&lt;sup>;2 &lt;/sup>;&lt;/a>;，到 2022 年，网络安全劳动力增至 470 万人，是有记录以来的最高人数。然而，仍有超过 340 万个职位空缺。这是一个严峻的形势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;托管检测和响应 (MDR) 可以解决可用人才短缺的问题。 MDR providers are outsourced services that can provide organizations with advanced security operations capabilities and work collaboratively with those organizations to remediate threats once they are discovered. They offer access to top professionals who provide input regarding roadmap-related decisions, and who can handle existing, new, and evolving threats. Enterprises find that an advanced MDR service provider makes it possible to do more with less — maintaining scalability while keeping head count down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current climate, MDR providers are increasingly relevant. It&#39;s not just about resources and how to use them, but also about how to build a roadmap moving forward. Shifting focus to evaluate cybersecurity as a business risk — while investing efforts specifically on the threats that pose the greatest danger — can help ensure that an enterprise is poised to detect and respond quickly enough to protect the organization&#39;s key assets. And that&#39;s the real goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the ever-growing threat of cyber attack, business leaders should be thinking about cybersecurity as a strategic business enabler. By illustrating the business case for cybersecurity — aligning cyber-risk management with an organization&#39;s business objectives — it becomes possible to make current and future decisions about the organization&#39;s cyber health in terms that the board can understand.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When Blind Hiring Advances DEI &mdash; and When It Doesn&rsquo;t]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/when-blind-hiring-advances-dei-and-when-it-doesnt]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_01_539661201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;jenniholma/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;As a decision-making strategy, &amp;#8220;blind hiring&amp;#8221; involves blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information about a job candidate until after an evaluation of their application materials are complete. Most famously, the tactic was used to boost the hiring of women in orchestras by having people audition from behind a screen that concealed their gender. But there&amp;#8217;sa body of research that&amp;#8217;s been conducted since that 2000 study showing that, while the strategy is generally effective, there are situations in which it might not help you diversify your candidate pool. The author outlines this research, and suggests three questions you should ask in order to get the most out of a blind hiring approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-blind-hiring-advances-dei-and-when-it-doesnt?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/when-blind-hiring-advances-dei-and-when-it-doesnt?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Inspired by the results of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.90.4.715&amp;amp;source=post_page-----deda93da109b----------------------&quot;>;orchestra study&lt;/a>; — where symphony orchestras began hiring more women by having people audition from behind a screen that concealed their gender — some major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/news/bbc-embraces-blind-recruitment/&quot;>;organizations&lt;/a>; are now using a “blind hiring” strategy to help achieve goals related to diversity. The typical blind hiring process involves stripping information from job application materials before review that could signal applicants&#39; memberships in specific groups and cue discrimination. Though not yet widespread, this de-biasing strategy is gaining traction: A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3768039&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; of over 800 US-based HR practitioners indicated that about 20% worked for organizations that used blind hiring and about 60% were familiar with it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What many practitioners may be unaware of, however, is the large span of new research on blind hiring that has been published since that orchestra study in 2000. Over the past two decades, the efficacy of blind hiring as a strategy to boost hiring outcomes for members of historically disadvantaged groups has been tested in the “field” — that is, in real hiring decisions in real organizations — in various settings across Europe, Canada, and the US By understanding the results of these recent studies, decision-makers in organizations can now determine, at a very granular level, whether a blind hiring strategy is likely to help or hinder their organizations&#39; efforts to diversify pools of new hires.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Is “Blind Hiring”?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a decision-making strategy more broadly, “blinding” involves blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information about a target of evaluation until after an evaluation is complete. Blind hiring policies typically implement this strategy at the initial screening stage of the hiring pipeline, when hiring managers or other decision-makers decide which applicants to interview and which to screen out of the pool.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations using blind hiring policies single out information conveyed in job application materials like resumes and application forms that is irrelevant to the job but could cue unconscious biases in managers. They then strip that information from materials before they are reviewed. Names, for instance, communicate nothing about people&#39;s skills but often communicate their gender and/or race; receiving this information can lead decision-makers to unconsciously favor applicants of certain groups, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561&quot;>;white people&lt;/a>;. Thus, an organization concerned about this type of discrimination might use a blind hiring approach, removing applicants&#39; names from their materials before letting managers see them. Other types of information, like college graduation years (which communicate age) or hobbies (which can signal social class), are similarly candidates for blinding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The logic underlying a blind hiring approach is simple: Discrimination against members of certain groups cannot occur at a given hiring stage if evaluators at that stage cannot discern applicants&#39; group memberships. Accordingly, decision-makers tasked with increasing the diversity of new sets of hires in their organizations may wonder whether a blind hiring approach could help them achieve that goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The State of the Science&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over roughly the past two decades, careful academic studies exploring the efficacy of a blind hiring approach have been undertaken across Europe, Canada, and the US In these studies, researchers have compared the proportions of job applicants from disadvantaged groups who are selected for interviews — at organizations in both the public and private sectors — when application materials are blinded or evaluated in the normal fashion. Generally (but not entirely), these studies have found that more applicants from disadvantaged groups advance to the interview stage when a blind hiring approach is used.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001979391206500105?casa_token=35AgNww0QpQAAAAA:KFt0QpS6nXTiWIIlbs86EhzSAjQV4DzCI_1imLlSF8bEZIWVfEuMGWvi2L-tKUewcqiDqXeDC0g&quot;>;one study&lt;/a>; in the public sector in Sweden, researchers found that more women and ethnic minorities were selected for interviews when their applications were anonymized versus when names were maintained. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hhsifauwp/2006_5F004.htm&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; in the Swedish public sector found that women who uploaded their credential information to a database used by potential employers were more likely to receive interview invites when their gender information was blinded. And in the Netherlands, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33332/&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; that people of non-Western origin, who represent a traditionally disadvantaged, Dutch job-seeker group, were more likely to be advanced to interviews for public sector jobs when application materials were evaluated in a blind fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the Atlantic, a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/publications/Name-blind-recruitment-pilot-project.html&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; by the Canadian government explored whether blinding information, including applicants&#39; names and also their citizenships, addresses, educational institutions, and religions, would impact interview selection rates for minority applicants to the public service. Results indicated that, while non-minority applicants were selected for interviews at a slightly higher rate than minority applicants under the traditional process, minority applicants were selected at a higher rate under the blind process. And in the US, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2021/08/31/jhr.0420-10831R1.abstract?casa_token=uu28ASzExNgAAAAA:Jqi4OO6HVJrJEuaKKJjv697-9xYg4EhfkaLPbXyGiWMQD0FUa1cgC2qa02zN2__16fSXRfk&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; in a restaurant chain indicated that older workers were more likely to be advanced to the interview stage when they submitted applications online, which blinded applicants&#39; ages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some studies, however, have been less positive on the effects of blind hiring. For instance, employers in France were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20140185&quot;>;less likely&lt;/a>; to select applicants from minority social groups for interviews when applicants&#39; names were blinded versus when they were provided on materials. Consistent with this finding, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://izajoels.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-9012-1-5&quot;>;large study&lt;/a>; in Germany found that blind hiring only boosted interview rates for job applicants from minority groups when employers tended to discriminate &lt;em>;against&lt;/em>; applicants from those groups under a traditional process. For employers who were &lt;em>;more &lt;/em>;likely to interview applicants from minority groups under a traditional process, however, the use of a blind hiring policy negated that tendency, leading to worse interview selection rates for applicants from minority groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Viewed together, these recent studies suggest that a blind hiring process often helps, but may sometimes hinder, organizations&#39; goals related to diversity. Informed by these findings, decision-makers should ask themselves three questions to understand whether a blind hiring policy is right for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Question 1: Does my organization systematically under-select applicants from traditionally disadvantaged groups for interviews?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Research suggests that blind hiring only boosts interview rates for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups when used by companies that typically under-select applicants from these groups for interviews. This makes sense intuitively — blind hiring will only help if there is bias to eliminate. Thus, if decision-makers are operating in organizations that are failing to diversify pools of new hires overall but are &lt;em>;succeeding &lt;/em>;at diversifying pools of interviewees, adoption of a blind hiring policy to govern the initial screening stage will not help diversity hiring efforts. Instead, they should focus on solutions that address biases during interviews and selection decisions afterward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversely, in organizations that have a history of selecting mostly members of advantaged social groups (eg, men, white people) for interviews, using blind hiring at the initial screening stage could help.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Question 2: Is the job in question one where being from an advantaged group predicts having the preferred credentials?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Blind hiring blocks unconscious biases by ensuring that decisions about whom to interview are based on credentials alone. However, due to systematic inequities in access to resources and opportunities between groups in society, members of traditionally advantaged groups are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/05/business/tech-internship-application-grind.html&quot;>;disproportionately likely&lt;/a>; to attend prestigious undergraduate universities, secure sought-after internships, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equityinhighered.org/indicators/enrollment-in-graduate-education/&quot;>;achieve a post-graduate&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.nau.edu/stem-graduate-programs/&quot;>;(eg, master&#39;s) degree&lt;/a>;. Thus, if the job being hired for is one where people with fancy credentials are especially likely to be selected for interviews — for example, a management position — members of advantaged groups may still have a leg-up under a blind hiring process, even though discrimination is seemingly blocked.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these cases, adopting a blind hiring policy to support diversity hiring goals may backfire. Instead, decision-makers might consider either broadening the span of “preferred” credentials for a position, or incorporating applicants&#39; social identities into interview decisions, so that complicated credentials can be evaluated through the lens of the hurdles — or privileges — applicants may have experienced along the way to achieving them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversely, if interview decisions are based less on having fancy credentials and more on straightforward evaluations of relevant skills and experience — for instance, if the job being hired for is an entry-level position — the discrimination-blocking benefits of blind hiring will likely lead to greater interview rates for members of disadvantaged groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Question 3: Are complementary de-biasing strategies being used at other stops along the hiring pipeline?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Say you have a job where, in the past, members of disadvantaged groups have been under-selected for interviews, and group membership doesn&#39;t predict applicants&#39; likelihood of having the “right” credentials. This job would clear the hurdles in questions one and two and could seem like a good match for a blind hiring approach. Even in this situation, however, a blind hiring approach on its own might not lead to more diversity in the ultimate pool of hires. Blind hiring can only be fully leveraged at the initial screening stage if paired with other de-biasing strategies operating before and after initial screens.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One complementary strategy that should be paired with a blind hiring approach is targeted recruitment of members of disadvantaged groups, such as through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/05/technology/bowie-hbcu-tech-intern-pipeline.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare&quot;>;pipeline programs&lt;/a>; at HBCUs. This strategy pairing addresses the fact that discrimination reduction in interview-selection decisions may not boost the diversity of interviewee pools if few members of disadvantaged groups apply in the first place. Blind hiring policies should also be paired with de-biasing strategies at the interview stage, since interviews are generally conducted in an unblind fashion. Indeed, in some of the studies described above, blind hiring boosted interview selection rates for members of disadvantaged groups but did not ultimately increase their likelihood of getting job offers after interviews. One especially promising strategy to reduce discrimination at the interview stage involves the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://outsmartingimplicitbias.org/module/how-to-conduct-a-structured-interview/&quot;>;structured&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2010.01172.x?casa_token=S_r9YqxRcY4AAAAA%3AWx8fD3stmGZi6u7rR5qPoF_fOm7GcbnD1LA01LgbujFdU9fYQsmlfaF56jTSLcZ1kI9J8TFZPhKs&quot;>;interviewing&lt;/a>;, which keeps interviewers focused on job-related questions only and reduces the impact of homophily — our natural preference for people who are like us — on interview assessments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By asking themselves these three questions, decision-makers can determine whether a blind hiring approach to the initial screening process will help or hinder their efforts related to diversity in hiring overall. And even for those organizations that do not clear these hurdles, a blind hiring approach can still be leveraged if modified carefully. For instance, an organization might still wish to use a blind hiring strategy even though the job being hired for is one where being from an advantaged group predicts having the “target” credentials, like a graduate degree or an Ivy League pedigree (question two). In this case, organizations can consider using a “blind-then-see” approach — hiring managers can form initial evaluations of applicants based on credentials alone, then learn information that was blinded, like demographics, and re-weight their initial appraisals, re-considering applicants&#39; credentials through the lens of the hurdles they may have had to overcome to achieve them. Research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959782200019X?casa_token=sAnj-BiCRNEAAAAA:DbKnwX-iAfWyJnBptZ19wJz2XUY-jimlLc7aQMUufGF9QeS34RY_zCQJlqLWxiatBc7AVkul&quot;>;suggests&lt;/a>; that a blind-then-see approach like this can reduce bias in favor of members of advantaged groups while still preserving the benefits of a blind, initial look at qualifications.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The key takeaway is that blind hiring is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In some cases, it may even be detrimental when it comes to goals related to hiring more applicants from disadvantaged groups. However, the state of the science surrounding blind hiring suggests that, for the right jobs in the right organizations, this strategy can open the door to the achievement of diversity-related hiring goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Actions CEOs Should Be Taking to Drive Growth With Their Ecosystem Strategy - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM EY-PARTHENON]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/05/4-actions-ceos-should-be-taking-to-drive-growth-with-their-ecosystem-strategy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-353332&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/03/EY_230625_HERO.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;By Jeff Wray and Greg Sarafin&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To retain market leadership, CEOs seeking to accelerate innovation in their organizations often find themselves at a crossroads: They must decide whether to build, buy, or partner. In response, a growing number of CEOs are embracing ecosystem business models—and with good reason.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ecosystems make up an average of 13.7% of the annual revenue of organizations using at least one ecosystem business model, according to a recent EY study, as well as driving 12.9% in cost reduction and generating 13.3% in incremental earnings. Beyond the numbers, ecosystems offer organizations clear benefits, such as greater access to technical capabilities talent and assets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite these benefits, however, ecosystem business models can be contractually, logistically, and commercially complex, with structures that are often unclear to new participants. These challenges multiply for CEOs who are uncomfortable being in a partnership arrangement where they can&#39;t be in the driver&#39;s seat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real questions CEOs should ask themselves are:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Are we ready for a mindset change?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Can we cede control, trusting our partners within a defined ecosystem business model?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Are we prepared to share the limelight to gain the greater benefits of a united value proposition?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Many types of ecosystems&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Organizations looking to access new growth opportunities with an ecosystem approach, as opposed to building it themselves or buying a company, need to identify the “right” ecosystem with the right arrangements and the right participants for the business goals they are trying to achieve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/alliances/seven-business-models-for-creating-ecosystem-value&quot;>;seven business models for creating ecosystem value&lt;/a>; are orchestrated marketplaces of large tech companies; setups that allow competitors with differing footprints to join forces, such as airline-loyalty alliances; and value-chain integration, such as Insurwave, a blockchain-based shipping insurance ecosystem built in conjunction with the EY organization and other collaborators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The benefits of ecosystems&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building, buying, and partnering are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

They allow firms to grow their multiples due to the capital- and cost-efficient way they access these opportunities using the expertise of their ecosystem partners.

The struggle stems from a narrow understanding of what an ecosystem “should” look like, based on preexisting industry norms, when the organization has already tested the obvious options and found and implemented the most promising variants.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;However, to stay ahead of the innovation curve, firms need to look at options they have not explored. Companies need to think bigger and bolder by looking at all seven ecosystem models, not just at those they are most familiar with. Each organization needs to investigate which one is best suited, based on the desired business outcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, organizations need to shift their focus to concentrate on the logic and governance of the ecosystem they are orchestrating or participating in, instead of just thinking about finding the right partner.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sports, a winning team is not necessarily a set of the best players, but of those who work well together on a defined game plan to reach a common goal. Most teams require a captain—an orchestrator. The rest of the team play vital roles, but they adhere to the common standards defined by the orchestrator.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This approach—where an orchestrator sets the common standards, but the niche roles are enacted by the rest of the team—can make sense when firms with niche capabilities are accessing new areas of growth, or where they and their competitors are both aiming to orchestrate ecosystems but clients are keen on avoiding overreliance on a single supplier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this scenario, CEOs need to ask themselves, “If I can&#39;t drive it, am I willing to take a back seat to access the growth I see in this new opportunity?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Implications and next steps&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To make the most of ecosystem opportunities, CEOs and C-suite leaders should consider the following steps:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Take a conscious look at the alliances and partnerships you and your competitors are a part of. Identify any patterns and ask if your organization is sticking to the mold that&#39;s most prevalent in your industry—or if you have explored the art of the possible in the ecosystem strategy.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ask yourself, “Am I just taking smaller comfortable steps that are close to my core business, or am I ready to take the leap of faith for broader growth opportunities?” When thinking about growth strategy, expand your horizons. Rethink how you have been considering your strategy and whether to pivot.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Revisit growth priorities you may have discarded. Were they set aside because they couldn&#39;t be unlocked with your current value chain structure? Can a suitable ecosystem change that?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Learn to let go! Embrace the opportunity to enter attractive new growth vectors where your organization might not be best placed to lead the charge on its own but can make a valuable contribution to a broader value proposition.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Learn more about how EY teams can help your organization master its ecosystem strategy.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/people/jeff-wray&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Jeff Wray&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>; is Global EY-Parthenon Leader. &lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/people/greg-sarafin&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Greg Sarafin&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>; is EY Global Alliance and Ecosystem Leader.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Additional contributors: &lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Andrew Hearn, EY Global Development Leader, Strategy and Transactions; Prachi Gupta&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Food and Beverage Sector Needs to Embrace Digital Transformation to Achieve Sustainability Goals - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/05/the-food-and-beverage-sector-needs-to-embrace-digital-transformation-to-achieve-sustainability-goals]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-356582&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/998-22433275-FB-HBR-Report_GMA_banner_1200x675.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Virtually every industry is striving to become more efficient and sustainable—and these goals are particularly important in the food and beverage sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Streamlining operations, reducing waste, and decreasing carbon emissions are essential to feeding a growing global population, protecting limited resources, and fighting climate change. Nearly 40% of food and beverage sector decision-makers said in a 2022 International Data Corp. survey that their organizations would prioritize sustainability in the coming year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These companies cannot achieve their sustainability objectives without undertaking the digital transformation of every aspect of the production process, from sourcing to manufacturing to distribution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the consumer goods sector, companies with advanced digital transformation strategies have cut greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and consumption of water and energy by up to half, according to Clarisse Magnin-Mallez, a managing partner at McKinsey &amp;amp; Company. By following a similar strategy of introducing the right talent and technology, food and beverage producers can both improve the bottom line through more efficient operations and contribute to global food security.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Digital Transformation Is the Path Forward&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digital transformation in the food and beverage sector can take many forms: adopting collaborative cloud-based platforms, updating to industrial internet of things (IIoT) infrastructure, and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to refine processes and better understand customer needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Integrating digital technology allows organizations to collect and analyze data to support sustainability in areas that were once a black box. Gaining visibility into operations and consumer behavior now helps organizations calculate the precise quantities and types of resources they consume, which helps them better identify ways to reduce waste and use of energy and water.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Keeping the human element in focus is critical to the success of digital transformation initiatives. Team members who fear that digitization will render them obsolete can pose significant obstacles to implementation. Building a culture that empowers employees to see how digital tools can make their work easier and better and that ensures they learn the skills to use the new technology is key to bringing the workforce along on the sustainability journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As with many industries, the food and beverage sector is struggling with a shortage of skilled workers. Promoting emerging or newly adopted technology in job descriptions can help recruiters make their open roles more appealing to prospects looking for cutting-edge careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Three Sites Leading the Way&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food and beverage producers that want to innovate may be stuck on deciding how to move forward. Nearly 70% of industrial firms undergoing digital transformation programs report being unable to move past the pilot stage, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://members.lnsresearch.com/research-library/research-articles/avoiding-pilot-purgatory-how-to-choose-the-right-use-cases-to-accelerate-industrial-transformation-(ix)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;LNS Research&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As pioneers in digital transformation in our own operations, Schneider Electric provides our know-how and experience to advance global sustainability by supporting industrial organizations embarking on similar efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digital transformation at three organizations in the manufacturing and food and beverage sectors illustrates how producers can embark on their strategies to plan, manage, and implement end-to-end transformation projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Smart Factory&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Le Vaudreuil, in northern France, a Schneider Electric plant that makes conductors, speed drives, and soft starters has transformed its operation into a smart factory.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;After outfitting its machines with wireless IoT sensors connected to cloud-based digital analytics platforms, the factory unlocked data to help it improve its performance and sustainability, cutting its energy use and carbon emissions by a quarter and its material waste by 17%. Implementing a zero-reject water-recycling station monitored by a cloud-based AI model led to a 64% drop in the facility&#39;s water use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the factory joined the World Economic Forum&#39;s Global Lighthouse Network, which recognizes manufacturing facilities achieving efficiency and sustainability through innovation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;IoT-Powered Analytics&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;A 65-year-old plant in Lexington, Kentucky, that makes load centers and safety switches was the first Schneider Electric facility to become a global lighthouse, in 2021. By combining IoT sensors with power meters and predictive analytics, the factory reduced its energy use by more than a quarter, its water use by 20%, and its carbon emissions by 30%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this facility, sustainability went hand in hand with efficiency. The average time to repair fell by 20%, and system downtime fell by 5%. The plant&#39;s investment in its digital transformation paid for itself within two years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Roadmap to the Future&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, one of the world&#39;s leading beverage companies launched a digital transformation and sustainability initiative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The organization works with Schneider Electric&#39;s Industrial Digital Transformation Consultancy Team to develop a vision and roadmap for becoming a “plant of the future,” laying the groundwork for a two-year implementation phase.

But to successfully create and communicate such strategies, managers must embrace incompatible and misaligned ideas, communicate multiple and conflicting narratives, and share ideas as they think of them as opposed to the traditional sequence of thinking then sharing. To enable this, leaders need to foster a culture in which people can disagree without being punished for it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/why-conflicting-ideas-can-make-your-strategy-stronger?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/why-conflicting-ideas-can-make-your-strategy-stronger?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/radical-optionality&quot;>;recent HBR article&lt;/a>; we argued that in an uncertain and rapidly changing world, companies need to adopt strategies predicated on radical optionality, in which they continuously develop new options that could form the basis of future success — depending on what unpredicted state of the world they will find themselves in. But companies struggle to realize radical optionality because creating options is expensive: It entails costly and risky exploration, increases complexity, and can lead to excessive redundancy. Encroaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/scarcity-doesnt-mean-the-end-of-business-heres-what-they-should-do&quot;>;resource limitations&lt;/a>;, especially an increasing cost of capital, only makes the challenge harder.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In addition to breaking a series of traditional trade-offs in strategy, as described in our article, this will also require a new approach to thinking about, communicating, and leading strategies. Fundamentally, we have to accept that strategy is no longer a single, unchanging roadmap, but rather a portfolio of possibilities that requires an altogether new playbook. To succeed in this new world of radical optionality, managers and leaders must embrace:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Incompatibility and misalignment of ideas&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Companies and individuals work on multiple initiatives and tasks simultaneously. The assumption is usually that although these activities may be very different, they are fundamentally consistent with one strategy and view of the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;However, organizations developing options for multiple possible future states of the world may need to simultaneously pursue non-complementary or even incompatible options. For example, NVIDIA sells its graphics cards to consumers, but it is also building up a cloud-based subscription service that can be used to access graphics power remotely and stream games or other software to (non-NVIDIA-powered) devices. In this case, solving one problem — for example, reducing streaming latency — could improve the attractiveness of NVIDIA&#39;s cloud-based offering, but potentially reduce that of its traditional hardware business (by cannibalizing its direct sales).&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Enhancing optionality requires recognizing the potential benefits of such incompatible options. These include &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/make-resilience-your-companys-strategic-advantage&quot;>;higher resilience&lt;/a>;, due to diversified future income sources, as well as the ability to create a foothold in a plausible future that relies heavily on centralized computing. Moreover, NVIDIA&#39;s move sets it up to benefit from a broader set of possible future innovations, as its cloud offerings will be improved not only by breakthroughs in hardware, but also by improvements in streaming software, among other advances.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Tomorrow&#39;s winners need to selectively embrace incompatibility in a similar manner by accepting divergent beliefs regarding the future, exploring different branches of the resulting “tree of possibilities,” and shifting attention and resources between them as the future unfolds.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;A multiplicity of beliefs about the future also has implications for &lt;em>;alignment&lt;/em>; among an organization&#39;s stakeholders. The “everyone on board” imagery is attractive: We are all sitting in the same boat, and rowing in sync will help us get to the finish line more quickly and efficiently. But, in a world of radical uncertainty, we may not always know what our destination is — or, indeed, whether a particular boat is our best option for getting there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;As a result, achieving total alignment can no longer be the governing maxim. Against an uncertain future, firms will need to foster a &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;diversity&lt;/a>; of perceptions (of reality) and perspectives (on the future), which, as they collide within the firm, will unlock new ideas through combinatorial innovation, improving the organization&#39;s future viability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Multiplicity and inconsistency of narratives&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;We often communicate &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/your-strategy-needs-a-story&quot;>;strategies using stories&lt;/a>; as engaging and useful simplifications of a complex reality. However, if different, potentially incompatible options for the future are being pursued, we can no longer rely on a singular, unchanging strategic narrative. Instead, organizations need to share and endorse multiple and changing stories to facilitate pursuing different options and switching between them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For example, around its highly lauded AI strategy in the past months, Microsoft has made statements highlighting the role of its software as a coach, an assistant, or an automation engine. Some of these stories prominently feature a human in the loop, while others do not. While these stories cannot all be true at the same time, in the same context, and for the same audience, Microsoft&#39;s ability to continuously evolve its narratives and offerings in a very rapidly developing landscape enable it to stay relevant.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In such a multi-storied world, organizations need to let go of the aim to achieve full consistency and stability of the narrative — which has been seen as a sort of hallmark of integrity — and instead embrace variety and change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Lou Gerstner provides a good example of inconsistent communication successfully deployed. When joining IBM as CEO in April 1993, he famously announced to investors and the press that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ebusiness/&quot;>;the last thing IBM needs now is a vision&lt;/a>;” and that he would instead be focused on streamlining and execution. But he did in fact drive work on a new vision: around enabling companies to leverage the internet for their businesses. He shared it publicly less than a year into his tenure and rolled out a $500 million advertising campaign around it soon after, which helped IBM become an early leader in the space.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Thinking by speaking&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;As much as narratives are communication devices, they are also valuable tools for formulating and testing strategies: Spelling things out — even if only for yourself — helps to structure thoughts and identify flaws in your logic. As poet and dramatist Heinrich von Kleist observed in an 1805 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ias-research.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kleist-and-Hamburger_-_1951_-_On-the-Gradual-Construction-of-Thoughts-During-Speech.pdf&quot;>;essay&lt;/a>;, just like &lt;em>;l&#39;appétit vient en mangeant&lt;/em>; — the appetite comes with eating — &lt;em>;l&#39;idée vient en parlant&lt;/em>; — the idea comes with speaking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When striving for radical optionality, communicating strategic ideas to others also opens a path for improving them. Rather than coming after thinking, speaking can in fact be a mode of thinking. We can test and develop strategies by saying them out loud, registering responses, and collaborating with our audience to triage and shape ideas. In this context, telling multiple, potentially inconsistent stories can be beneficial because it creates valuable reactions that can be observed and harnessed. We can extend EM Forster&#39;s famous quote from “How do I know what I think until I see what I say?” to “How do I know what I think until I see&lt;em>; how others react to &lt;/em>;what I say?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;em>;Thinking by speaking &lt;/em>;can be put into practice inside the firm, to “try on” and understand different beliefs. For example, executives can conduct workshops in which they put themselves in the shoes of industry mavericks — startups that are betting against the incumbents&#39; business models — and discuss how their ideas might succeed. This and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/imagination-games-tools-for-sparking-innovative-business-ideas/10608&quot;>;imagination games&lt;/a>; we have developed to facilitate such workshops is an effective way for testing ideas and updating your mindset.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Moreover, &lt;em>;thinking by speaking&lt;/em>; can also be done in an outward-facing manner, gauging public reactions by floating a “trial balloon,” as when a politician leaks plans to the press, companies showcase prototype products or even just announce the development of an offering on a crowdfunding platform. A recent well-publicized example is Twitter CEO Elon Musk&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587312517679878144?lang=en&quot;>;public discussion&lt;/a>; about Twitter Blue subscription prices with platform users.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The transition to a new culture&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality,” wrote Max De Pree, leadership guru and former CEO of Herman Miller. Company leaders, as “chief meaning makers,” set the tone and establish the context for what is thought or said in their organizations. Thus, they must also lead the charge on the shifts in mindset and communication practices that will unlock radical optionality. This will require that they:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Act as examples:&lt;/strong>; They must be comfortable with telling multiple stories and contradicting themselves when new narratives emerge and rise in relevance. This is not an exhortation to fabricate or distort facts and ground truths, but rather a recognition that facts can support &lt;em>;many&lt;/em>; possible narratives that are not necessarily compatible with one another, that circumstances change and our knowledge evolves.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Set new norms:&lt;/strong>; To harness the power of &lt;em>;saying by thinking&lt;/em>;, employees must be confident that “testing out thoughts” that are not yet fully formed and vetted with colleagues does not entail a career risk. Of course, guardrails also must be set for thinking out loud in public forums, where repercussions are greater if an idea is not well-received or ultimately not delivered upon.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Create a safe environment:&lt;/strong>; To foster and harness the collision of different perspectives, leaders need to provide spaces for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/the-playful-corporation/&quot;>;playfulness&lt;/a>; and ensure that employees can feel safe to experiment with new ideas, processes, and practices.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: 400; text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Success in a world of radical optionality will require a culture that embraces experimentation with new and often conflicting business and operating models. To achieve this, companies will need to recognize that strategy is a portfolio rather than a road map.&amp;nbsp; Managers will need to lean into multiple and conflicting narratives, while creating strategies and crafting messages in real time.&amp;nbsp; The challenge for leaders will be to make the organization safe for employees to think and communicate in these new ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 31 May 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Protecting DEI Progress When Budgets Are Tight]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/05/protecting-dei-progress-when-budgets-are-tight]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/May23_31_1387910052.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;zhengshun tang/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In the face of a strained macroeconomic environment, businesses are having to make tough decisions about how to spend their limited resources.

To operationalize this, we&#39;ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CbsV168JighgRkC57bKSiYCWKvD9jBa3WfVXf8tGyU/edit&quot;>;templates&lt;/a>; for an annual diversity, inclusion, and belonging plan that each vice president is required to submit as part of their annual goal-setting process. The templates, which are grounded in our corporate DEI goals,&amp;nbsp;enable VPs to set department-specific metrics and a cadence of strategic reviews. Leaders are invited to share their observations, generate hypotheses on root causes and commit to no more than a handful of annual DEI actions.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-357245&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/W230512_THOMAS_DEI_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Complement your DEI team with external partners to meet your evolving needs.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Effective DEI teams thrive on agility as they meet ever-changing business needs, priorities, and economics. For example, over the last three years, our needs at Upwork have evolved in the following ways:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;In 2020, we prioritized training hiring managers to bring increased rigor to their decisions, as well as belonging and retention for our Black employees.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;In 2021, we invested heavily in community-building and belonging, including 53 events to expand the visibility of team members from marginalized identity groups.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;In 2022, we focused on providing access to professional development, partnering with the McKinsey Management Accelerator to build leadership and management capabilities for Black, Latinx, and Asian emerging leaders, and partnering with Korn Ferry LeadershipU to enable LGBTQ+ (senior) managers to support their teams through today&#39;s multifaceted challenges.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;We have a small but highly flexible hybrid DEI team (made up of 60% freelancers) to ensure we have the organizational capacity to meet these evolving needs. Our corporate positions are for evergreen workstreams where we will need long-term leadership and change management. Our contract roles are for time-bound strategic programs or evolutions, and we partner with external organizations to expedite time to delivery, protect team time and capacity and/or supplement our internal subject matter expertise.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. &lt;strong>;Make DEI a core part of your corporate operating and communications agenda.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Like any innovative corporate strategy, your DEI efforts will face natural pivots, setbacks, and adjustments. Most employees can accept a shift in strategy as long as communication is frequent and transparent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid DEI becoming a nice-to-have rainy-day activity — especially during a time when worker wariness of companies&#39; commitments is heightened — make sure you&#39;re continuously shining a light on your efforts. Develop a cadence of publicly reporting progress against your goals, and bake visibility into your existing company meetings and rituals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, at Upwork, along with my peers in HR, I report monthly to our executive leadership team on our topline DIB objectives and key results. Our senior director of DIB meets bimonthly with vice presidents to review progress against their annual DIBs plans. Our weekly all-company ConnectUp forum often includes timely DIB and culture updates for all team members, who play an active role in fostering a psychologically safe, fair and inclusive environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consistent communication in these formal channels — along with more casual updates and nudges via Slack — legitimizes DEI as core to organizational health and reinforces mutual accountability for DEI outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need a seven-figure budget to enable team members to drive systemic change. In fact, I dream of a day when companies don&#39;t need dedicated DEI teams. There&#39;s extra value in having a specialized function with deep expertise, but real progress will be realized when DEI impact can happen without one. In the face of economic uncertainty and scarcity, there&#39;s no time like now for organizations to test their readiness for a truly mature organization, where DEI is integral to how work is done.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 31 May 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Take Better Breaks at Work, According to Research]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/05/how-to-take-better-breaks-at-work-according-to-research]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/May23_31_SelmanHosgor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Art by Selman Hoşgör; malerapaso/Getty Images (hourglass); Iryna Veklich/Getty Images (clock); Westend61/Getty Images (woman on laptop); WeAre/Getty Images (woman doing yoga); Johannes Mann/Getty Images (workman); Anton Vierietin (man holding head)&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Taking periodic work breaks throughout the day can boost well-being and performance, but far too few of us take them regularly &amp;#8212; or take the most effective types. A systematic review of more than 80 studies on break-taking outlines some best practices for making the most of time away from our tasks, including where, when, and how. It also offers tips for managers and organizations to encourage their employees to take more beneficial and more frequent breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-take-better-breaks-at-work-according-to-research?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-take-better-breaks-at-work-according-to-research?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For many of us, being productive means spending more time working. It seems intuitive that the more time we spend on job tasks, the more we can get done. And not surprisingly, the popular literature is rife with advice on how to maximize work time. For example, the “daily routines of CEOs” often include things like waking up at 4 am, working on the weekend, and even being “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/culture/marissa-mayer-says-the-secret-of-success-is-working-130-hours-a-week/&quot;>;strategic about how often you go to the bathroom&lt;/a>;.” To tackle an ever-increasing workload, many workers choose to grind through, skip lunch, and stay after hours.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the cost of being always-on (and doing it well!) is high. More than half of employees (59%) report feeling burnout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aflac.com/docs/awr/pdf/2022-trends-and-topics/2022-aflac-awr-employee-well-being-and-mental-health.pdf&quot;>;according to a recent survey from Aflac&lt;/a>;. Engagement has taken the opposite turn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/workplace/468233/employee-engagement-needs-rebound-2023.aspx&quot;>;is declining among the US workers&lt;/a>;. Alarmingly, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/LODJ-11-2015-0249/full/html&quot;>;high burnout&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0972150916631082&quot;>;low engagement rates&lt;/a>; are associated with hindered performance. What can we do to address our declining well-being while maintaining performance?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pausing work rather than pushing through might help with both aspects. Intrigued by two competing narratives — one focused on working more as an indicator of performance and the other on having regular respites to protect well-being — as well as mixed (and sometimes even conflicting) findings of individual studies on these topics, our team conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-90592-001&quot;>;systematic review of existing research on workplace breaks&lt;/a>;. In analyzing more than 80 studies, we (with our colleagues Zahra Premji, Timothy Wingate, Connie Deng, Lisa Bélanger, and Nick Turner) confirmed that pausing work throughout the day can improve well-being and also help with getting more work done. Counter to the popular narrative of working long work hours, our research suggests that taking breaks within work hours not only does not detract from performance, but can help boost it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why is taking breaks is beneficial for well-being and performance?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Like batteries that need to be recharged, we all have a limited pool of physical and psychological resources. When our batteries run low, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036904&quot;>;we feel&lt;/a>; depleted, exhausted, and stressed out.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pushing through work when very little energy is left in the tank puts a strain on well-being and work performance. In extreme cases, nonstop work can lead to a negative spiral: A worker tries to finish tasks despite their depleted state, is unable to do them well and even makes mistakes, resulting in more work and even fewer resources left to tackle those same tasks. This means that the more we work, the less productive and more exhausted we can become. Think about reading the same line for the fifth time, for example, and still not absorbing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news is that taking breaks can help employees to recharge and short-circuit the negative spiral of exhaustion and decreasing productivity. However, not all breaks are equal in terms of their effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What types of breaks are more effective for improving well-being and performance?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Breaks come in many different shapes and forms: exercising, browsing social media, going for a short walk, socializing with others, taking a nap, grabbing lunch, and so on. However, our systematic review shows that not all break types are equally effective. In other words, it matters &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to pause work. Here are some common break elements to consider:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Break length and timing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A longer break does not necessarily equate to a better break. Disengaging from work only for a few minutes but on a regular basis (micro-breaks) can be sufficient for preventing exhaustion and boosting performance. For example, workers can take short breaks for snacking, stretching, or simply gazing out of the window. Further, timing of the break matters — shorter breaks are more effective in the morning, while longer breaks are more beneficial in the late afternoon. This is because fatigue worsens over the workday, and we need more break time in the afternoon to recharge.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Location of breaks&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The place breaks take place can make a big difference in terms of recovery. Both stretching at a desk and going outside for a short walk seem like very similar break activities, but they might substantially differ in their recharging potential. Our review demonstrates that taking a break at outdoors and enjoying the green space is far better for recharging workers&#39; resources than simply staying at a desk.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Break activity&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Engaging in physical activity during a break is effective for improving both well-being and performance. Exercising is an especially valuable recovery tool for mentally demanding work. However, the positive effects of this break type are short-lived, and employees need to exercise on a regular basis to yield its benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite these benefits, exercise is not the most preferred way to spend breaks among employees. Our review shows that browsing social media is the most common break type — almost everyone (97%) report engaging in this activity. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215302703&quot;>;researchers find&lt;/a>; that scrolling through social media during work breaks can lead to emotional exhaustion. As a result, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215302703&quot;>;people end up with&lt;/a>; diminished creativity and work engagement instead of replenished resources. As such, this type of break may not be effective for boosting performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Furry break companions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/19/3670&quot;>;One study&lt;/a>; in our review showed that interactions with a dog can lower levels of cortisol hormone, an objective indicator of stress. More research is needed in this area, as the effects on performance remain unclear. We do, however, have a strong suspicion that spending a break with a furry companion is effective for many employees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F1076-8998.6.1.81&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that interactions with pets can substantially boost individuals&#39; psychological wellbeing, which in turn is &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-15533-008&quot;>;strongly linked to performance&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What can managers and organizations do to encourage breaks?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The mere availability of breaks does not guarantee benefits. Workers may not use their breaks in the most efficient ways or take them at all. As decision-makers and role models in organizations, managers are in an important position to encourage effective work breaks. This can be achieved in several ways:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Fostering positive attitudes toward breaks&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While employees are generally positive about breaks and report that they are beneficial for performance, this sentiment is not always shared by managers. This can deter people from recharging. Thus, it is critical that managers are informed about the performance-related benefits of work breaks. For example, HR managers can incorporate this information in the company&#39;s wellness training programs. Organizations can also consider implementing “wellness moments” (akin to safety moments) during which they can share their strategies for taking effective breaks and brainstorm fun break activities. Even hanging posters about the benefits of and best practices in taking breaks in the workplace can go a long way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Taking breaks themselves&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Managers can communicate the importance of taking breaks by taking the most effective types regularly, which employees can mimic. For example, a manager who regularly walks her dog in a nearby park can communicate to her employees that she&#39;ll be stepping away from work for a bit to do so. Such strategy not only sets a positive example, but also sets clear boundaries around not interrupting breaks. Leading by example will help prevent the possible stigma and guilt associated with taking breaks. It&#39;s promising that more and more organizational leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinemba.wsu.edu/blog/5-ways-the-worlds-top-ceos-maintain-their-work-life-balance/&quot;>;are recognizing this&lt;/a>; and even share their &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/12/im-a-ceo-and-a-working-dad-heres-what-i-wish-i-did-differently&quot;>;regrets about not taking sufficient time off work&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Scheduling dedicated break times&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our review shows that many employees are unable to take regular breaks, or are dissuaded from doing so because of the stigma; thus, we recommend that managers and organizations schedule dedicated break times. Such break times need to be implemented with care. Rigid break schedules, such as mandating employees stop working only at a certain time and of a predetermined length, reduce employee autonomy and can even have harmful effects on employees. We recommend offering break periods at a certain length such as one hour a day and leaving when and how often they want to take their breaks at the employee&#39;s discretion. Offering flexible work schedules, innovative workplace break initiatives such as “break tickets” (eg, giving daily tickets that allows employee to take an hour of their choice off), or providing on-site social or physical activities could be some examples of optimal break scheduling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Creating spaces for breaks&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As we highlighted above, the location of breaks can play an important role in maximizing their benefits. For example, having a small park or indoor green space can communicate the organization&#39;s commitment to facilitating work breaks and enhance the benefits of breaks in relation to employee performance. To further yield benefits of outdoor breaks, you could also make it an off-leash dog park where employees who enjoy interacting with animals can do so. This can also serve as a recruitment tool as &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/pandemic-pet-boom-has-increased-the-demand-for-pet-friendly-workplaces-200217&quot;>;the demand for pet-friendly workplaces is rising&lt;/a>;, and many companies have already adopted &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-68687-003&quot;>;pet-friendly policies&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations with employees working from home can also make use of the spaces available to them by arranging online park meetings where remote workers can join the meeting while walking or sitting at an outdoor space that is convenient to them. Alternatively, they can allocate a “break budget” for employees to create their own break space. For example, employees can buy an indoor plant or a yoga mat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employee performance has always been a concern for organizations, and more organizations are making efforts to address employee well-being today. Work breaks as a promising tool to improve both. Organizations need to recognize the importance of breaks and engage in deliberate efforts to facilitate effective breaks.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 31 May 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Roadmap to Success for the U.S. Semiconductor Industry - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM ARIZONA COMMERCE AUTHORITY]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/05/a-roadmap-to-success-for-the-u-s-semiconductor-industry]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-357154&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/ACA_HERO-SunsetHiker-Rocks-RIGHT-1200x720-1.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Yogi Berra once said, “If you don&#39;t know where you are going, you end up somewhere else.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an industry as important as semiconductors, “somewhere else” won&#39;t cut it. Semiconductors, or microchips, are the brains of modern electronics—and they&#39;re central to America&#39;s economic and national security future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the US to lead the world in semiconductor manufacturing and innovation, we need to know where we&#39;re going.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CHIPS and Science Act, signed into US law in 2022, represents a crucial first step. The historic initiative appropriates $52 billion for semiconductor research and manufacturing programs while establishing a temporary tax credit specific to semiconductors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To succeed, the CHIPS Act needs a roadmap, a plan to guide our actions today and in the decades to come.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For that plan, look to the National Semiconductor Economic Roadmap (NSER).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;A national strategy, industry led&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;NSER (pronounced “answer”) is a 10-year industry-led plan for increasing US competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing and strengthening supply chain resilience, charting a path for leaders in industry, government, and academia to strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem for a technology the US invented.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NSER offers rigorous data and analyses, establishing clear goals and objectives across four domains: infrastructure, supply chain, workforce, and entrepreneurship. States including Arizona are pioneering innovative solutions to advance these four objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, Arizona &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azcommerce.com/news-events/news/2022/11/governor-ducey-announces-100-million-to-enhance-arizona-semiconductor-ecosystem/&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; $100 million in funding to enhance its semiconductor infrastructure, workforce, and research capabilities, with a focus on the accelerated development, commercialization, and manufacturing of next-generation US semiconductor-based technologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, innovative programs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.maricopa.edu/blogs/semiconductor-manufacturing-industry-booming-jumpstart-your-career-10-days&quot;>;Semiconductor Technician Quick Start&lt;/a>; are directing more women and minorities to the industry. A partnership of the Maricopa Community Colleges, Arizona Commerce Authority, and Intel, this two-week, 40-hour boot camp teaches fundamental skills and includes the opportunity to interview with Intel upon graduation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Reversing a semiconductor slide&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent decades, the US has experienced a steady decline in semiconductor manufacturing as production capacity shifted overseas, with China and other countries in Asia investing heavily in chip manufacturing and research and development (R&amp;amp;D). On its current path, the US share of microchip manufacturing could decline from 11% today to 8% by 2033—down from 40% 30 years ago.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Realizing the full value of the CHIPS Act and growing the entire manufacturing ecosystem will require policymakers, industry players, academia, and other stakeholders to work together in areas of precompetitive common interest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these stakeholders achieve NSER objectives, the US could capture as much as 30% of capital investment in the semiconductor industry globally over the next 10 years, according to Boston Consulting Group. That could increase the US share of global capacity by as much as 17%, reversing the decades-long slide.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;A shift of this magnitude would have significant benefits for US economic resilience, driving the creation of thousands of high-paying jobs, advancing our technology leadership, and strengthening US national security.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So where do we begin? NSER begins with infrastructure.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Enhancing domestic infrastructure&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Semiconductors represent one of the most capital-intensive sectors in the US economy. Chip manufacturing requires physical sites, equipment, and transportation infrastructure in addition to a well-educated workforce and R&amp;amp;D facilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NSER&#39;s long-term vision involves aligning the domestic regulatory and incentive environments with competing markets to increase US attractiveness, investing in shared R&amp;amp;D infrastructure to encourage collaboration, and enhancing infrastructure to improve sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Increasing supply chain resilience&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The semiconductor supply chain&#39;s extreme complexity puts the US at great risk of disruptions of the flow of goods and services. These risks most acutely apply to materials, wafer fabrication, and packaging, assembly, and testing (PAT).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The East Asia region accounts for approximately 80% of all PAT capacity, 40% of it in mainland China. The US supports less than 5% of global PAT capacity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To improve US resilience, NSER prescribes increased onshore, near-shore, and friend-shore activities. This effort should include establishing dependable sources of materials, consumables, intermediary products, and equipment while increasing domestic semiconductor-manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But because complete onshoring would be expensive and impractical, the roadmap also advocates maintaining US access to global markets and improving supply chain visibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Solving the people problem&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the semiconductor industry&#39;s greatest challenges is building its workforce. In the US, the sector employs roughly 277,000 workers. To meet the future labor demands NSER envisions, that labor pool would need to grow by hundreds of thousands of people over the next decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Attrition rates; declining interest among American students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and inflexible immigration barriers contribute to the obstacles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NSER proposes a robust set of actions to bolster the talent pipeline by ensuring equitable and inclusive access to training, increasing skilled-worker retention and addressing reversible attrition factors, and ensuring the workforce remains adaptable to evolving industry needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Empowering entrepreneurs&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entrepreneurs contribute to the semiconductor industry by improving processes and production methods, often resulting in incremental gains that catalyze US competitiveness and elevate the entire industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenges entrepreneurs face, however, are substantial, such as attracting funding and accessing the facilities, equipment, and materials manufacturers require to test products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NSER recommends the expansion of private, government, and academic investments in entrepreneurs; improving access to facilities and knowledge; and fostering a spirit of collaboration among research universities, startups, and industry players.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CHIPS Act has reinvigorated the US semiconductor industry for the 21st century. To capitalize on this momentum, the sector now must take heed of the bigger picture and act quickly to improve the entire manufacturing landscape.

While these are often good and pleasant, micro trainings can&#39;t solve macro problems—and I&#39;m here to tell you it won&#39;t make a difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s needed now is nothing short of a total overhaul of how organizations develop and prepare their leaders to move their company into the future and propel themselves into the C-suite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;re probably thinking, “Upskilling?多年来我们一直这样做！”你是对的。 It&#39;s always been used as a long-term investment that enables performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;But while it used to be a “nice to have,” it&#39;s now a business-critical priority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, every organization has needs that run from incredibly strategic to deeply personal—some need their people leaders to transform entire functions, solve their supply chain challenges, and retain customers, while others need their people leaders to accelerate their digital transformation, exhibit flexibility, and showcase empathy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whatever the case may be, here are three ways organizations can get started and identify the right steps to align the skills of people leaders with the goals of the C-suite:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;De-silo your research and get brave. &lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most companies are drowning in employee and candidate data.问题不在于数量；它的连接性。 Employee and candidate data only tells part of the story, and usually HR owns and protects that data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why does this matter? Because very few listening tools can help a front-line manager identify the future skills required of their team to meet the needs of customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what to do?停止孤立地查看员工反馈，开始将其与消费者、客户和部门数据（包括顾问范围和支出）联系起来。 Create a cross-functional team that&#39;s accountable for telling the whole story about what your people need, especially your people leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ask the team to identify where they are failing the customer experience.询问他们为什么员工要离开以及这对合作伙伴有什么影响。 Ask them whether you&#39;re hiring consultants to solve the problems our own team should be able to solve.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Create your own list of painful, difficult questions, and ask the team to see what the data can tell you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one in your organization can own this view except the C-suite.因此，不要指望其他任何人对此进行授权。 CEO, CHRO/CPO, CFO, COO…you own this.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Stop focusing on symptoms and start focusing on root causes.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve all heard the phrase, “People don&#39;t leave bad jobs, they leave bad managers.” People also leave companies that think a meditation app is going to compensate for leaders who don&#39;t know how to lead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not knocking mediation apps. （我手机上有两个）。 But asking the right questions and getting to the root of what needs to change across the enterprise to meet growth objectives is key.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Offering employees a free subscription to a meditation app can have a positive impact on the employees&#39; day-to-day, but it&#39;s not going to solve what&#39;s causing them to feel stressed and burnt out in the first place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, to decrease blood pressure and increase job satisfaction, leaders can ask questions like: “Are our people leaders trained to lead?” “他们知道如何传达战略并将其转化为他们的团队吗？” “人事领导者是否知道如何展示端到端的思维并采取行动？” “人事领导是否知道他们需要做什么才能实现最高管理层的目标？” And then ask “why” as you begin the process to uncover root causes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Activate the enterprise to meet C-suite goals.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that you have gathered feedback and collected data, it&#39;s time to activate the skills and competencies needed of people leaders—and across the enterprise—to meet the goals of the C-suite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To do this, leaders must determine where the skills gaps are, identify which skills the people leaders lack, and decide which skills to refine to lead the organization into the future. Now is the time to create trainings and build a learning culture to bring people leaders up to speed, and to equip them with the skills they will need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it doesn&#39;t end there.除了持续和全面的学习，您的组织还必须设定目标和成功目标。 70/20/10 模型在这里会做很多，这意味着 70% 的培训是通过在职经验完成的，20% 通过与他人的关系和互动完成，10% 通过正式培训和教育。除此之外，测量过程将显示培训是否有所作为。 It can&#39;t just be about how trainees feel—it&#39;s about connecting the training back to business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of this is easy.这需要一点勇气、一些最高管理层的责任心和极大的好奇心。 Your managers are holding your teams together, and they deserve to be positioned to succeed, learn, and grow into the next generation of leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Chris Thornton is Group Senior Principal at Daggerwing.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Learn how Daggerwing can help your organization &lt;a href=&quot;http://daggerwinggroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;create a culture of learning&lt;/a>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 31 May 2023 00:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
