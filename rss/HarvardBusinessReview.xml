&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;风险与回报&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;组织通常会花费过多的时间、金钱和资源来建立供应商网络以保持业务正常运转。但供应链面临的全球威胁——流行病、气候变化、战争——从未停止出现。完全依赖这些系统来顺利运行可能会使您的运营面临风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;组织依靠他们的采购领导者来引导创新并使采购更加灵活，以保持竞争力并始终为中断做好准备。虽然成本节约仍然是重中之重，但德勤 2021 年全球首席采购官调查的受访者将运营效率 (78%)、数字化转型 (76%) 和创新 (73%) 视为关键战略目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数字采购为这些领导者提供了解决采购挑战的解决方案，包括轻松安全地让用户入职、预算自动化、订购、交付和开票。此外，从遗留系统提供的基本采购数据转向数字采购系统生成的更复杂的分析，可以为管理人员提供洞察力，以跟踪和控制支出、推动合规性、监控采购模式，并实现更大的、组织范围内的目标。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;解决后勤挑战&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;作为全球最大的能源公司之一在世界范围内，雪佛龙的采购需求复杂多样。 2018 年，该公司对其采购系统进行了全面改革，并转向 Amazon Business 满足其采购需求。这一一站式采购解决方案将消费者购物体验的轻松和熟悉的用户体验与强大的实时分析、省时的功能和一套支出管理控制相结合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;管理和策划再订购列表使雪佛龙 300 个公司拥有的加油站的管理人员能够减少他们在采购过程中花费的时间。 “我们已经能够采购到我们需要的物品，并将它们放在重新订购清单上。它还为我们提供了具有竞争力的价格，”雪佛龙公司运营主管 Nicole Cannon 说。 “商店经理可以登录 Amazon Business，点击他们需要的所有商品，然后将它们添加到购物车。这是一个五分钟的过程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，灵活、可预测的运输选项可帮助员工按需获得所需的用品。对于雪佛龙加油站的员工来说，存储空间非常宝贵，从一组精选清单中及时发货已经发生了变革。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们看到大多数产品具有相当显着的成本优势， ”雪佛龙中部大陆业务部物流经理 Kevin Jackson 说。 “但最重要的是提高了员工的士气，因为他们能够更快地获得所需的东西，减少繁文缛节，减少程序。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;跟踪进展可持续发展目标&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了提高效率和降低成本之外，数字化采购业务还为公司提供了工具来跟踪企业社会责任 (CSR) 等战略目标的进展情况。 Guided Buying（一项 Business Prime 权益）等功能使管理人员能够将某些产品指定为首选，因此公司可以通过增加供应商多样性、本地采购或购买更具可持续性的供应品来控制支出以支持其 CSR 目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国沃尔沃汽车公司 (Volvo Cars) 根据公司对可持续发展的承诺，使用引导式采购来扩大采购规模和采购来源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们正在激励我们的零售商去除所有一次性塑料，对我们来说，所有零售商都只有一个流程很重要，”沃尔沃汽车高级采购专家亚历克斯彭宁说。 “我们通过补贴我们鼓励他们使用的部分产品来帮助零售商，我们可以跟踪并确保他们收到了这些产品。它消除了沃尔沃网络开发团队的大量手动工作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;让您的业务永不过时&lt; /strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;组织必须将其采购系统视为一项战略业务功能，以在竞争中脱颖而出，而基于云的数字采购对该战略至关重要。寻找可以帮助简化运营并平衡成本和效率的合作伙伴不再是增长战略的战术补充；当今的业务环境使其成为必要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过优化采购并迁移到基于云的采购系统，您的组织可以变得像它需要的那样敏捷，实时响应不断变化的采购需求以加强您的整个经营业绩。向数字购买的转变使您的组织和员工能够专注于最重要的优先事项：开发产品和服务、实现您的战略目标以及发展您的业务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;已经使用或有兴趣将 AWS 用于云服务的客户可能能够受益于互补的 Amazon Business 采购服务，帮助您做出更快、更明智的供应链决策。例如，AWS Supply Chain 是一种基于 AWS 云的应用程序，可提供对运营的实时可见性，以帮助您预测和降低库存风险。作为集中式订购解决方案，Amazon Business 可以帮助您简化 B2B 采购，并通过企业就绪 &lt;a href=&quot;https://amazon.com/&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;自 2020 年 4 月以来，美国的远程医疗访问量急剧下降，但大流行病的结束不应意味着远程医疗的结束。它可以在提供医疗保健方面发挥重要作用。挖掘其潜力的关键是将诊所的许多元素带给患者。一系列新技术和服务正在使这成为可能。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to -tap-the-full-potential-of-telemedicine?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-tap-the-full-potential- of-telemedicine?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;远程医疗的好日子已经过去了吗？我们不认为他们是，尽管考虑到公共卫生紧急情况的结束，这种担忧是可以理解的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2023/02/public-health -emergency-ends-may-11-telehealth&quot;>;废除了许多与流行病相关的远程医疗法规&lt;/a>;。但我们相信，只有将诊所的更多元素带给患者，才能达到更高水平的虚拟护理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在 Covid-19 大流行开始时，&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2021/feb/impact-covid-19-outpatient-visits-2020-visits-stable-despite-late-surge&quot;>;前所未有的远程医疗使用率&lt;/a>;，一些人考虑这是否是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/well/live/coronavirus-telemedicine-telehealth.html&quot;>;新常态的开始&lt;/a>;——与远程医疗作为患者接受护理的核心组成部分。迄今为止，结果更多的是适度的变化，而不是范式转变。自 2020 年 4 月达到顶峰以来，美国每月的远程医疗就诊人数已大幅下降，今天代表 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/outpatient-telehealth-use-soared-early-在 covid-19 大流行中，但已经消退/?_hsmi=2&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_h3xgzFnAv73r2B9XiyWd63I_0EzL_J3AOC6HoSru2U0AGu4F2zB3Oxh_LJ6IHR7as9_qGP0ZMmTkvT6r vDoJiz3YQ-Q&amp;amp;utm_campaign=KFF-2022-冠状病毒&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=2&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email &quot;>;约占所有门诊就诊的 5%&lt;/a>;。患者和医生在很大程度上已经转回亲自就诊，在许多情况下，因为他们&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.01027?journalCode=hlthaff&quot;>;质疑远程医疗访问中的护理质量&lt;/a>;，特别是无法进行身体检查和关键测试（例如心电图）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;补救措施是将医生办公室的关键方面带给患者.新兴产业旨在填补这一空白。患者已经可以使用&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2794655&quot;>;联网设备&lt;/a>;在家里和其他地方检查他们的血压、血糖和其他生理指标与他们的医生远程分享。也有通过 Apple Watch 等消费者可穿戴设备获取此数据的活动。 LabCorp 和 Quest 等实验室测试提供商提供广泛的“患者服务中心”网络，用于在医生办公室外采集样本，并提供越来越多的家庭邮寄测试套件。便携式诊断服务提供商可以直接到患者家中进行 X 光和超声波检查或抽血进行实验室检查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些变化只是冰山一角。这个未来不需要停留在简单地重新创建标准的医生就诊，而是可以通过使用数字听诊器或超声波等新设备远远超出它。在医生办公室检查孩子的耳朵很困难。通常，医生只能短暂地观察一下鼓膜。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tytocare.com/&quot;>;TytoCare 的 Home Smart Clinic&lt;/a>; 和其他类似设备在理论上可以产生比办公室可用的&lt;em>;更好&lt;/em>;的检查通过帮助父母获得孩子耳膜的综合视频，可以将其发送给医生并根据需要重新观看。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新技术甚至可以收集医生办公室无法获得的数据。尽管这听起来很超前，但越来越多病情最严重的患者在体内植入了用于控制病情的设备。美国有数百万心力衰竭患者有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109712028100&quot;>;植入式起搏器&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(13)00104-5/fulltext&quot;>;除颤器&lt;/a>;，或其他设备。这些设备不断记录各种数据，其规模超过了诊所收集的任何数据。研究人员正在努力寻找&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-00445-9#Sec8&quot;>;利用这些丰富数据的新方法&lt;/a>;来改善慢性病管理.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些新兴技术还有可能显着改变患者与其提供者互动的方式。虽然以前患者可能每隔几个月就去看医生一次，但这些新产品允许进行更频繁的监测，有时甚至是 24/7 全天候监测。结果是对患者的健康状况和进展有更丰富的了解。在传统的护理模式中，患者有责任开始护理。在这种新模式中，医生可以在出现问题时立即观察并抢先联系他们的患者，在最需要的时候让患者参与进来。此外，通过将数据收集与就诊本身分开，确实发生的医患互动可以最大限度地提高效率，专注于治疗和指导，而同步互动非常适合提供这种互动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然有巨大的对于远程医疗的未来潜力，必须克服&lt;a href=&quot;https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/4/e24743&quot;>;关键障碍&lt;/a>;。对于普通患者和提供者而言，其中许多技术成本过高，尤其是仅供偶尔使用时。考虑到医疗保健的典型消费者年龄较大，而且平均而言，对技术的了解程度较低，因此易用性也可能是一个主要问题。健康公平也是一个重要的考虑因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;远程医疗的未来应该是民主化的，并且让农村人口、种族/少数民族和其他历史上服务不足的社区都能使用。为最需要它的患者打开这个未来需要新的流程和机构，使这些设备能够负担得起，但也提供必要程度的“人性化”以克服技术障碍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href= “/2022/05/the-telehealth-era-is-just-beginning”>;混合模型&lt;/a>;结合了虚拟和面对面接触可以帮助缓解许多这些障碍。例如，可以在当地诊所、药店或杂货店或工作场所设立实体远程医疗托管站点；这些托管站点可以为远程医疗就诊、最新的远程医疗技术以及熟悉该技术并可以提供面对面患者支持的“远程演示”人员提供空间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然我们强调“将诊所带到患者身边”，我们承认还有许多其他因素会影响远程医疗的未来发展轨迹。随着与 Covid 相关的临时远程医疗政策的预期废止，&lt;a href=&quot;http://nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2210790&quot;>;未解决的问题&lt;/a>;关于远程医疗报销的未来和监管将看起来像。此外，当谈到新的远程医疗技术时，健康计划和自保雇主在支持和覆盖这些产品方面将发挥的作用仍然不明确。然而，这种不确定性并没有阻止寻求在这一领域创新的公司的财富。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;远程医疗尚未充分发挥其潜力，因为许多医生和患者认为就诊缺乏必要的检查和测试能力，无法提供最高质量的护理。然而，新技术和护理方法正在推动前沿，不仅是虚拟就诊，而且是整个医疗保健。对于医疗保健提供者、保险公司和雇主而言，重要的是要了解这些趋势并确定您将如何为您的患者、受益人和员工促进远程医疗的新未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，技术，很少会单独解决。一定程度的“人情味”始终是必要的。公司和供应商必须确定以具有成本效益的方式将此与技术一起提供的方法。这可以通过确定提供跨越技术和面对面支持的真正端到端解决方案的合作伙伴或通过建立内部系统（例如基于雇主的远程医疗托管站点）来实现。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span >;总结。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;一项针对 B2B 公司的研究发现，只有十分之一的公司能够持续以高于销售和营销费用的速度增长销售额。随着公司寻求在不确定的经济中削减成本，提高商业生产力是一项明智的战略。研究表明，公司可以通过三种方式做到这一点：改进进入市场的模式，将每个代表转变为 A 参与者，并提高销售和营销支持的效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt; div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-strategies-to-boost-sales-and-marketing-productivity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/3-strategies-to-boost-sales-and-marketing-productivity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;差不多了不言而喻的是，收入的增长需要以同样的速度增加销售和营销成本。大多数销售和营销负责人骨子里都相信，他们的团队在很长一段时间内无法提高生产力。团队可以找到削减成本和提高效率的方法，是的，但不是全面的、持续的生产力提高。这是一种破坏性的、自我强化的信念——我们的研究表明它不一定是真的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们关注的指标是所谓的“商业生产力”，它衡量收入（或毛利润）每美元商业成本返回，然后评估收入增长相对于销售和营销费用增长的速度。我们想更好地了解管理者是否相信随着时间的推移很难推动商业生产力的持续提高，因此我们进行了一项研究。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们分析了 10 个国家的 1,254 家上市企业对企业公司2017 年至 2021 年全球行业。我们发现，在所有行业中，平均每家公司在任何一年的商业生产力都持平，收入增长与销售和营销费用的增长速度相同。大约 19% 的公司在任何给定年份将商业生产力提高了 10% 以上，但大多数最终都将其收回。只有 5% 的公司能够在四年中的三年内实现商业生产力的提高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些精英公司（持续的生产力领导者）获得了另一个巨大的收益。他们实现了比同行高得多的年度股东总回报 (TSR)，平均相差 12%。 TSR 优势从物流和运输领域的 21% 到纸张和包装领域的 4% 不等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究确定了试图提高商业生产力的常见方法，这些方法注定要失败，或者充其量只能表现平庸.一种方法包括仅关注成本，这会阻碍长期增长。在其他情况下，公司严重依赖最新的销售或营销软件或未经证实的人工智能工具，然后看到成本增长而收入增长却没有相应增长。其他人可能会将不合理的生产力提升纳入他们的计划，而没有切实的途径来实现这些目标，这可能导致销售代表无法实现目标并退出。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;生产力领导者的不同做法&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们的研究表明发现商业生产力领导者多年来系统地追求三个领域的杠杆。他们改进了进入市场的模型。他们提高了一线的生产率，试图让每个代表都成为 A 级员工。他们还确定了销售和营销支持的效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;改进进入市场模型。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;这需要评估如何针对可能带来的机会部署销售和营销能力产生最高的回报。太多的公司依靠回顾性销售数据和过时的覆盖模型来确定他们需要多少代表以及将他们分配到哪里。这些覆盖模型往往会生锈，从而降低销售和营销组织的投资回报。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据客户的预期未来支出重新平衡帐户分配，为客户创建最合适的区域，要有效得多每个卖家。领先的公司调整他们的客户细分，并将客户重新分配到更有利可图的市场途径，使用成本更低的覆盖范围，例如内部销售、离岸角色和适当的电子商务。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;将每个代表变成 A &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;为了提高一线代表的工作效率，公司可以采用多种策略。一个是创建以数据为依据的销售策略——一组与目标客户协调的销售和营销活动，包括量身定制的销售抵押品和跟踪，以确保代表专注于最高价值的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;持续的培训和指导也帮助缩短新秀的上手时间并提高老将的表现。贝恩研究发现，与表现不佳的代表相比，表现最好的代表与其经理的互动更频繁、质量更高，例如每周一对一的会议和定期的管道审查。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;进行销售和营销&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;运行精益支持团队可以节省大量资金或释放运营费用，用于面向客户的销售活动。优化支持支出需要找到合适的数字和自动化工具来简化复杂的流程。此外，其他策略包括提高个人代表配额的准确性（由支持团队设置）、减少组织中的跨度和层级，以及审查非销售和非配额角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;生产力领导者系统地执行这些类别中的每一个策略。想一想一家计算机应用程序安全提供商在年收入增长从大约 40% 放缓至不到 20% 后如何改进其覆盖范围。公司扩大了客户群的数量，并为每个细分市场创建了更多量身定制的销售活动。它根据总目标市场、每个客户的购买倾向和客户特征重建了销售区域。这些举措和其他举措使这家安全提供商在连续四年中的三年内实现了超过 10% 的商业生产力提升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他公司也开始了类似的旅程，以释放商业生产力。一家跨国食品包装公司已开始通过多种策略改变其进入市场的模式。它们包括根据机会和服务需求重新细分客户，更多地使用内部销售和电子商务等低成本的市场途径，以及在全球范围内汇集专家资源。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;设计和重复&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;除了不断重新审视一套经过验证的杠杆之外，真正让生产力领导者与众不同的是他们采用深思熟虑且可重复的方法来执行变革。他们的方法有几个组织层面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，他们指定了一个明确的商业生产力负责人，通常是一个专门的角色。这位高管通常直接向首席收入、财务或运营官报告，并拥有专门的计划资源。员工帮助建立积压的策略来执行，推动每个策略的进展，并协助改变销售和营销各个级别的流程和行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经验丰富的生产力领导者还将商业生产力目标与年度和多年规划，使工作范围扩大到销售团队之外。为此，CRO、CFO 和 COO 必须定期就明确的生产力问题进行沟通。 CFO 的收入和销售/营销成本目标应反映销售和营销组织的预期生产力收益，并有一套明确的策略来实现这些收益。多年的商业生产力路线图必须与 IT 路线图相吻合，这样公司才能规划所需的技术投资。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，成熟的商业运营团队对于建模销售和营销能力、与财务沟通至关重要组，并创建不断修订的上市蓝图。运营团队确保策略在不同的地区和业务线中始终如一地发挥作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;在经济低迷时期提出正确的问题&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CRO、CFO 和 COO 致力于保持他们的生产力收益将想要解决一系列高收益问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;我们的组织是否知道推动商业生产力的因素以及我们是否达到、高于或低于我们的目标？&lt;/li>; &lt;li >;到明年、三年、五年后，我们需要在哪些方面提高生产率以及提高到什么水平？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;将结合哪些策略来制定实现目标的现实路径？&lt;/li >; &lt;li>;我们是否拥有正确的结构、运营模式和高层领导的参与来实现这些收益？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;谁负责实现这些收益？他或她是否与财务、人力资源和其他职能部门的领导者建立了正确的报告和沟通机制？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;保持商业生产力的提高会给任何行业和任何阶段的公司带来好处经济周期。但这在当前的宏观经济条件下尤为重要，因为经济低迷会重新安排董事会。贝恩分析发现，在 2008-09 年的经济衰退期间，全球近 3,900 家公司的业绩差异很大。在随后的扩张中，赢家远离输家，并扩大了利润和市值差距。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天同样适用。商业生产力框架迫使公司在收入和成本节约行动之间做出健康的权衡，这些权衡将帮助他们在未来几年加速超越竞争对手。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-brands-can- sell-to-environmentally-conscious-nonconsumers?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-brands-can-sell-to-environmentally-conscious-nonconsumers ?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;在气候变化日益明显的世界中，我们都会遇到正在改变行为以帮助保护环境的人：骑自行车上班的人为了避免消耗燃料，携带自己的餐具以避免使用一次性塑料叉子，或者挂在他们的可回收垃圾上，绕过垃圾桶，直到他们找到合适的地方来回收它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些人有两件事共同点：一方面，他们对环境的关注足以改变他们的日常习惯。另一方面，从表面上看，这种行为改变并不包括购买贴有环保标签的产品。因为他们目前的可持续生活之路侧重于减少消耗（燃料、塑料、家庭能源等），所以他们没有将可持续性与他们需要购买的产品联系起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们称这个群体为&amp;nbsp; “有意识的非消费者”，根据贝恩最近的研究，他们现在约占美国所有消费者的 32%。对于寻求新的增长来源的大品牌来说，它们已成为某种圣杯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毫无疑问，消费者越来越关注环境问题，即使只是因为他们在家里打人。最近的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/08/12/most-americans-who-have-faced-extreme-weather-see-a-link-to-climate -change-republicans-included/&quot;>;皮尤研究中心民意调查&lt;/a>;发现，71% 的美国人在过去一年中在他们的社区经历过极端天气事件。贝恩消费者实验室在 2022 年对近 4,000 名美国消费者进行的研究显示，直面气候变化已导致 52% 的美国人表示他们“极度或非常关注”气候变化的影响2023 年对 1,000 名消费者进行的后续调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人们对环境问题的日益关注为“有意识的非消费者”的潜在 3650 亿美元市场铺平了道路（在“有意识的消费者”的 2780 亿美元市场之上”），根据贝恩研究，如果公司消除阻碍购买的障碍。这是一个涵盖从减少包装的产品到需要更少水的洗发水的一切事物的市场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，充分抓住这个机会对消费品公司来说将是一个挑战，因为消费者日益增长的担忧并没有统一反映在他们的产品中。购买行为。不可否认，消费者所说的他们想要的和他们实际放入篮子里的东西之间存在着不可否认的“说做”差距。然而，缩小这一差距的回报是巨大的。当消费者尝试并喜欢可持续产品时，他们更有可能成为直言不讳的拥护者。例如，根据我们的研究，推荐环境、社会和治理 (ESG) 产品的人中有 44% 是超级推荐者，这意味着他们会向 10 人以上推荐产品，而出于任何其他原因推荐的人中这一比例仅为 22% .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand the landscape and biggest opportunities for consumer goods companies and retailers, Bain&#39;s recent survey of US consumers looked at such factors as their concern about climate change and the number of lifestyle changes made for sustainability reasons. Our research enabled us to identify five well-defined segments, all of which span age and income levels:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Climate change deniers: &lt;/strong>;These consumers don&#39;t believe that the climate is changing. As such, they do not engage with ESG and do not intend to. They make up about 4% of the US consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Consumers of habit: &lt;/strong>;These consumers tend to simplify their lives by buying products they know and love. They are not actively concerned about climate change, so sustainability is not on their minds when shopping. They make up about 30% of the US consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Curious consumers: &lt;/strong>;These consumers buy eco-friendly products due to a curiosity about these products, which are often branded as premium. They are not actively concerned about the environment, but they like to try new premium products. They make up about 11% of the US consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Conscious nonconsumers: &lt;/strong>;These are people who are actively concerned about climate change and have several environmentally friendly lifestyle habits, but do not buy eco-friendly-branded products. They make up about 32% of the US consumers — the largest group.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Conscious consumers: &lt;/strong>;These consumers are actively concerned about the planet and consider a product&#39;s environmental credentials when shopping, as they see this as a route to more sustainable living. They make up about 24% of the US consumers.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;It is the Conscious Nonconsumers — a large group that has flown under the radar of many consumer products companies and retailers — who offer a large, untapped opportunity. We focused much of our follow-up research on this segment, attempting to discover what&#39;s keeping them from buying and what consumer goods companies and retailers can do to capture this market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no single demographic profile of the Conscious Nonconsumer. They span ages as well as income and education levels. They&#39;re as likely to live in urban areas as small towns. What most have in common is a desire to match their current lifestyle changes — lowering thermostats, cycling to work, and obsessively recycling, for example. We also see that while many Conscious Nonconsumers are opting out of trying to shop sustainably, they do have positive intentions. An impressive 71% of Conscious Nonconsumers say they would pay more for sustainable products, in theory, if there is a direct benefit, if it doesn&#39;t compromise other factors, and if they believe it is really better for the planet, employees, or suppliers. Among our survey respondents, 44% of Conscious Nonconsumers aspire to increase spending on such brands in the next three years.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Barriers to buying&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;But since Conscious Nonconsumers are not currently buying sustainable products, as part of our study, we asked additional questions&amp;nbsp;to understand the barriers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first barrier — and probably the one most difficult to overcome — is that these consumers are not actively thinking about sustainability when they are shopping. This barrier, reported by 34% of Conscious Nonconsumers, highlights how this segment thinks about sustainability. They focus on reducing their consumption of fuel, home energy, and the like, with less concern about the products they buy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second barrier is one faced by Conscious Nonconsumers who &lt;em>;are &lt;/em>;thinking about sustainability when shopping: 37% percent say there are difficult trade-offs preventing them from making informed purchasing decisions. They have trouble understanding and comparing the carbon footprint of competing products, for example, and often start with only a vague understanding of what makes a product sustainable or not. We saw this knowledge gap come to life when we asked consumers across segments to determine which of two items had a lower carbon footprint. On average, 75% of respondents in all consumer categories did not know or were incorrect in their answer. For example, only 11% correctly answered that single-use plastic bags have a lower carbon footprint than single-use cotton bags. Only 22% correctly answered that inorganic vegetables have a lower carbon footprint than organic meat. This knowledge gap is a barrier to making the right choices in sustainable purchases.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final barriers to purchasing are tangible. Price was cited as an obstacle to purchasing by 34% of Conscious Nonconsumers; those higher prices mean that consumers need to work harder to justify purchasing. Another issue: It often is harder to find sustainable products. For example, consumers may need to go to a specialized store or a different department within a regular supermarket to find a wider range of sustainable goods.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to reach Conscious Nonconsumers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Brands and retailers can acknowledge their own accountability in the say-do gap and take immediate action to remove barriers that consumers and shoppers face. In our 2022 survey, half of US consumers believe brands and retailers are responsible for helping consumers shop sustainably — compared with 19% who feel it&#39;s the government&#39;s responsibility, for example. There are three basic actions for brands and retailers:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Simplify decision-making for consumers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Brands can help boost awareness and close the knowledge gap by highlighting specific, measurable ESG features that educate consumers while guiding choice. Beauty company Natura clearly spells out the specific, positive effects of its fair-trade practices with communities in Brazil&#39;s Amazon rainforest. On its website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naturabrasil.fr/en-us/our-values/sustainable-development&quot;>;it reports&lt;/a>;: “By buying Natura EKOS products you are helping to improve the income of 2,000 families in these Brazilian farming communities — a total of almost 8,500 people. And it is also thanks to Natura EKOS products and the work of these communities that 1.8 million hectares of forest have been conserved for sustainable resource use and a better future for generations to come.” Natura EKOS product packaging uses clear terms (such as vegan, Amazon rainforest ingredients, fair trade, and rainforest conservation), and quantifies the products&#39; benefits, such as the fact that purchasing refillable products results in a 25% reduction in plastic for EKOS products. It consciously avoids confusing consumers with multiple ESG symbols.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For retailers, simplifying consumer decisions means making sustainable products part of consumers&#39; purchase journey. That could involve helping consumers easily identify sustainable products. For example, Walmart offers an online collection of products by companies the retailer classifies as “Sustainability Leaders” and uses a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/hunger-nutrition/great-for-you&quot;>;Great for You&lt;/a>;” icon to help consumers identify healthier food options on the shelf. Retailers can also benefit by making sustainable products more available at the moment when consumers are making their purchasing decision by keeping them on the same shelf as everything else.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Integrate ESG into existing reasons to choose.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Consumers already balance competing priorities of quality, price, health, and convenience. Adding a new ESG dimension creates additional complexity that may force consumers not to choose sustainable options. The most effective companies weave ESG into those existing considerations. For example, insurgents have proven that ESG can make a product more convenient to purchase (via plastic-free automated subscriptions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://smolproducts.com/&quot;>;Smol&lt;/a>;), more affordable (via durable, reusable products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.upcirclebeauty.com/products/hemp-and-cotton-makeup-pads&quot;>;UpCircle&#39;s&lt;/a>; makeup removal cotton pads), and simpler (via multibenefit and multifunctional products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://carenb-com.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=sc&quot;>;Care Natural Beauty&lt;/a>;). Incumbent brands must follow their lead. Retailers can accelerate sustainability adoption by reinforcing the positive side of the cost-benefit equation through incentives. Iceland, for example, offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.iceland.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/reverse_vending_machines.pdf&quot;>;“reverse” vending machines&lt;/a>; where PET bottles are returned in exchange for store credit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Evolve existing brands.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our research found that Conscious Nonconsumers are likely to value&amp;nbsp;same-but-better versions&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;of products&amp;nbsp;they love as long as they do not come with a significantly higher price tag. There are two fundamental approaches brands take: innovating on packaging design and adapting product formats or ingredients. As an example of the former, consider Unilever&#39;s TRESemmé brand, with shampoo bottles made of 100% recycled and recyclable plastic. For its part, retailer Sainsbury&#39;s sells meat and chicken in trayless packaging and has eliminated single-use plastic across its own-brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/sainsburys-plastic-dip-pots/&quot;>;dip pots&lt;/a>;. As an example of adapting ingredients, Mustela introduced plant-based baby towels as a plastic-free version of its original baby towel.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Converting Conscious Nonconsumers is a matter of providing viable and easy-to-find options — and making the value proposition clear. And with value-for-money a critical consideration for this segment, the brands and retailers that make the biggest inroads will be those that can also make their sustainable products affordable. For most companies, that requires balancing the delivery of sustainable products with cost savings. It&#39;s a tricky balance, but one that will help companies achieve profitable growth by convincing consumers that, in addition to recycling, biking to work, and lowering the heat, they can change their buying habits, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;em>;The authors would like to acknowledge Luciana Batista for her contributions.&lt;/em>; &lt;/div>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 05 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Today&rsquo;s Cyber Threats Require Modern Cloud Network Security - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM MICROSOFT X AMD]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/06/todays-cyber-threats-require-modern-cloud-network-security]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-356576&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/05/Azure_AMD-Hero_Image-for-HBR-Network-Security-Article.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;By Narayan Annamalai&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When cybersecurity measures fail, the results can be devastating and costly. In the past year, network security failures have led to downed websites, delayed flights, unavailable video games, and much more. Such incidents can erode customer, investor, and board member trust and result in the types of headlines you don&#39;t want. Technology challenges and the growing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks spur conversation—and understandable worry—across industries. CISOs and other C-Suite members, as well as security professionals, recognize how increased cloud adoption and the shift toward hybrid work have expanded the attack surface. Some leaders also mention the challenges represented by the dynamic and complex regulatory landscape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider these security statistics:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;The annual cost of cybercrime is expected to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;>;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot; href=&quot;https://cybersecurityventures.com/stats/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;exceed $20 trillion by 2026&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;One cybersecurity &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;>;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot; href=&quot;https://eng.umd.edu/news/story/study-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;attack occurs every 39 seconds&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The &lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;>;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot; href=&quot;https://securityintelligence.com/articles/most-common-cyberattack-patterns-2022/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;four most common types of attacks in 2022&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>; were ransomware, email compromise, supply chain attacks, and attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Your network is the heart of your organization—and a tempting prize for bad actors. Network security puts controls in place to help prevent cybercriminals from breaching it. Let&#39;s explore how.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Protecting your data and assets&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cloud network security can keep pace with modern cybersecurity threats in a way that&#39;s not possible with conventional security tools. It can secure the data and applications that are essential to supporting hybrid workforces in cloud environments. And it enables you to protect organization assets from emerging attacks and secure both apps and infrastructure.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Network security in the cloud is important because all assets are accessed over a network. Here are the major components of effective network security in the cloud:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Zero Trust approach:&lt;/strong>; Zero Trust means using least-privilege access to limit user access, always authenticating identity, and minimizing blast radius and segment access by assuming a security breach. It helps you manage people, devices, data, and assets so you can enable a hybrid workforce, protect sensitive information, and manage multicloud assets with confidence.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Network firewall:&lt;/strong>; A network firewall helps prevent cybercriminals from accessing your network resources by monitoring and inspecting your network traffic and blocking malicious traffic.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;DDoS protection:&lt;/strong>; Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks involve cybercriminals targeting a website or service by flooding it with traffic to disrupt network services. DDoS protection typically provides monitoring, attack mitigation, and other features as defenses.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Web application protection:&lt;/strong>; Web applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) are popular targets for cybercriminals, as they are accessible over the public internet and may provide access to sensitive data. Web application protection helps protect websites, applications, and APIs from attacks.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Network security in action&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manufacturers create a significant volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property and research and development data. The IoT devices they use are highly targeted in DDoS attacks. And their supply chains are frequent targets as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manufacturers may be more willing than those in other sectors to pay criminals ransom because of the sensitivity of their data and their reliance on the supply chain to receive product components and to ship their products. Attacks that target the supply chain could bring operations to a standstill.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s take a look at a common manufacturing use case—secure connected insights, which can be used for theft prevention, loss&amp;nbsp;monitoring, warehouse optimization, and traffic flow insights across a&amp;nbsp;city or in a retail environment to automate stock replenishment. Manufacturers can monitor the activities of their warehouse floors, assembly lines, production, and distribution in real time via a connected factory setup.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along with machine learning and compute technologies for mission-critical analytics, manufacturers and other industries need cloud network security to ensure that data is secure and disruption is minimized. It secures your apps and network infrastructure against threats. The benefits of using network security include reducing security threats, improving operational efficiency, and increasing business agility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cloud network security services, like those of &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/network-security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;>;Azure Network Security&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;, paired with Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines powered by AMD, ensure you can deliver secure connected insights efficiently.

Modern network security can answer the call with a Zero Trust approach, network firewall, DDoS protection, and web application protection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Microsoft and AMD share the objective of prioritizing network security services—fully secure modern network protection for Azure workloads.

But understanding imposter syndrome does little to end it. The author, who studied underrepresented board members for his PhD and who interacts with hundreds of aspiring and existing board directors in his role at an executive search firm, has found that attributes of moxie &amp;#8212; strength of will, self-discipline, and the ability to persist despite challenges &amp;#8212; were vital to underrepresented directors&amp;#8217; success.

Another director, explaining that she “grew up in the shadows of a plantation” reflected, “It&#39;s still very much a white male show, so the fact that I was the first African American female on the board was astounding to me.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As US practice leader of CEO and board services at Boyden, an executive search firm, I interact with hundreds of aspiring and existing directors. Questions about their qualifications for board service remain a concern for many of the people I talk to, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My experience aligns with &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-3204.30.3.495&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; that shows that high achievers from underrepresented backgrounds often find themselves confronting imposter syndrome, or doubting their skills and achievements or fearing being exposed as a fraud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/impostor-syndrome-diversity-equity-inclusion-issue&quot;>;Women and people of color&lt;/a>; may be more likely to feel they don&#39;t fit in, they&#39;re not welcome, and they don&#39;t belong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imposter syndrome can be crippling mentally and emotionally, drain your energy and attention, and cause you to fall short of the performance you are capable of, thus, feeding the cycle of self-doubt. If you experience imposter syndrome, you may explain away your successes by thinking anyone could have done what you did, or thinking you just got lucky, or fearing that others are mistaken in believing that you&#39;re talented. As if that isn&#39;t bad enough, when you stumble or face challenges, your self-perceived incompetence looms larger than life — increasing your chance of failure and perpetuating the syndrome.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While awareness of this cycle is helpful, understanding imposter syndrome does little to end it. Instead, you need action. And to take action, you need moxie.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Moxie: A Working Definition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Moxie reflects &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03304-7&quot;>;an intensity of motivation&lt;/a>; and is related to (but distinct from) traits such as grit, self-control, and the ability to overcome procrastination. The term was &lt;a href=&quot;https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/456883/pdf&quot;>;popularized&lt;/a>; by a 1920s soft drink advertised to give its drinkers vigor, nerve, and pep. After Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams endorsed the drink, moxie entered the cultural consciousness as shorthand for strength, aggressiveness, skill, and know-how.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proquest.com/docview/2670010304&quot;>;my own research&lt;/a>;, I&#39;ve seen that the attributes of moxie — strength of will, self-discipline, and the ability to persist despite challenges — was vital to underrepresented directors&#39; success. One Latina executive I spoke with described moxie in this way: “I noticed my Black colleagues overcoming the objections coming at them in their careers. Whenever they set goals, they achieved them. They had a &#39;refuse to lose&#39; mentality. And once I emulated what I saw in them, I rapidly ascended the corporate ladder myself.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The directors I interviewed explained that they neither internalized the obstacles they encountered as personal failures, nor did they externalize them as irreconcilable systemic barriers. In fact, when I asked them to identify the barriers they faced, it took them a while to recall and identify them because they had transformed their obstacles into sources of motivation. It became apparent that moxie was a response to their childhood experiences of racism, sexism, microaggression, and other difficulties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are a woman or person of color and you want to push forward and advance in your career, you will encounter obstacles and you will experience failure. At these times, you have a choice to make: Will you allow the obstacles and failures to feed imposter syndrome, or will you pick yourself up and use moxie to persist toward your goal?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you choose moxie, you may not be disappointed. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03304-7&quot;>;a study&lt;/a>; by psychology professor Jessica Curtis and colleagues, moxie was found to predict intrinsic and extrinsic motivation more than other motivational constructs like grit or self-control. Moxie also predicted goal achievement — largely because people with moxie invest more resources into their aims. For example, one director I interviewed realized that her career choice of spending years as a consultant and then becoming CEO of a small company created substantial obstacles to her landing a corporate board seat. “Boards still tend to recruit against a checklist of wanting a sitting CEO of a multinational corporation,” she explained. “So when I&#39;d approach recruiters, they would push back with, &#39;Ooo…ah…I&#39;ll &lt;em>;really&lt;/em>; have to convince the board that it is worth it for them to speak with you.&#39;” At this point, she could have agreed with others&#39; opinions that she wasn&#39;t boardroom material. Instead, she recognized the need to translate her experiences and skills into language a board would understand and find attractive. Now, only a few years into board service, she sits on three publicly traded company boards and three nonprofit boards.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Making Moxie Your Superpower&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Based on the experiences of the underrepresented directors I interviewed in my study and the aspiring and existing directors I continue to interact with, I suggest four tactics to help you make moxie your very own superpower:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1. Utilize the strengths you&#39;ve forged through culture-based hardships.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;People of color have endured centuries of hardship and oppression and, through these, we have forged attitudes and approaches that give us unique advantages, as research regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177/0095798419889752&quot;>;racism-related coping&lt;/a>; and posttraumatic growth following racial trauma has shown. Tabitha Grier-Reed and colleagues at the University of Minnesota &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/tra0001220&quot;>;have found&lt;/a>; that deepening your connections with others, harnessing your inner strengths, developing fresh perspectives and appreciation for life, and connecting with your spirituality, in particular, help us grow and flourish in our careers and life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One Black women board member I interviewed explained that her grandparents had raised her to understand the inequity of opportunities presented to people of color. As a result, she persisted through barriers because, as she put it: “I had no choice. Like other women of my generation, we were told by our parents and grandparents to just get out there and do it. Make it happen. If you&#39;re given an opportunity, demonstrate to them that you deserve the opportunity.” Similarly, the other directors I interviewed explained that they learned to ignore, go under, go over, go around, or go through any obstacles put in front of them — in other words, they used moxie.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To turn your own hardships into moxie, identify a challenging situation from your past that you ultimately overcame. Reflect on how you got through it and how you resolved the situation. Finally, formulate these as the principles you learned and strengths you gained. Together, these are some ingredients of your unique brand of moxie.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, women and students of color &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-technology-math-race-ethnicity-gender-diversity-gap&quot;>;commonly report&lt;/a>; facing negative stereotypes when enrolling in STEM courses. One such woman recalled, “I had to take organic chemistry, but without the years of preparatory courses all my classmates had. So I had lots of questions that seemed very elementary to others. As a result, everyone — students, lecturers, and my mentor — thought I didn&#39;t belong there and refused to help me.” To overcome this formidable challenge, she explained, “I spent many sleepless nights reading extra material, going over class notes and homework multiple times, and slowly caught up. I ultimately graduated from my degree program with one of the highest grades.” From this experience, this young woman recognized that she relished challenge and realized she could rely on her strengths of a strong work ethic, self-discipline, focus, and ability to learn unfamiliar, scientific material with limited support. This moxie continued to help her flourish in her career.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. Give yourself permission to play. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Herminia Ibarra, professor at London Business School, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.2307/2667055&quot;>;conducted extensive research&lt;/a>; on what she calls “identity play,” which involves experimenting with new ideas and behaviors as you take on new professional challenges and roles. She uses the term “play” to normalize the idea that you won&#39;t perform as well in the new role as you do in more familiar roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, play is not a “fake it till you make it” situation. Instead, it&#39;s about authentically growing into new roles by trying new behaviors, gaining confidence, and allowing yourself time and space for development. This was a critical tactic for one director I interviewed, who explained, “Debt financing, bond markets, and the investor base were foreign concepts to me. So when these came up, I reminded myself that I had to have just enough knowledge to stay on the stage, and I kept trying and focused on being a learner.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To foster your own identity play, think of a work situation where you are still on a learning curve. Break the situation or role into a series of small learning experiences with deliberate action planning, experimentation, and gathering data on your performance. Then repeat the cycle.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. Tune out the naysayers.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you are working hard to achieve much in your career and life, you are bound to encounter naysayers who are more than eager to point out the ways you don&#39;t measure up. The late Kaleel Jamison, a pioneering career woman in 1970s corporate America, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Nibble-Theory-Kernel-Power-Self-Empowerment/dp/0809141876/ref=asc_df_0809141876/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=312281483245&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=1946812945678087117&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9002000&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-760812857192&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;>;called these messages “nibbles”&lt;/a>; intended to make you smaller.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you agree with the nibble (or, worse, initiate the nibble yourself), you feed the imposter syndrome. I recently witnessed this in a young and talented mentee of mine who has been spearheading transformative change in her company despite having taken her role only months ago. While her proposed initiative had been blessed by her boss and her CEO, another leader above her blocked her with, “Well, your plan is completely unworkable.” She slid into a pit of paralyzing self-doubt. Having seen the plan myself, I knew the criticism was unfounded but suspected there was more to the story. Once we debriefed on the situation, I realized that she had circulated her plan in a way that inadvertently criticized the leader&#39;s work, resulting in a predictable backlash. We then discussed more effective ways to solicit support from the various stakeholders involved—including the leader in question. She then created and implemented a more successful approach, in turn, learning from this experience and strengthening her competencies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you experience criticism, begin by reframing it as a hypothesis (eg, “The plan will not work”). Next, identify ways to test the hypothesis, such as by getting feedback from trusted mentors or conducting a low-risk proof of concept. Third, gather data and test the hypothesis. Regardless of the results, you will gain concrete and actionable feedback that will help you progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. Recognize when to walk away.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Imposter syndrome often is used to mask systemic bias and racism in the workplace, as Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey aptly &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome&quot;>;noted&lt;/a>;. This means that moxie won&#39;t work in every situation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One director I interviewed had a longstanding dream to become the CEO at her employer. “I eventually realized that even though I was performing well, I couldn&#39;t control how the leadership decided who actually got C-suite opportunities and who didn&#39;t. So, I made the hard decision that I still wanted to be a CEO, but it didn&#39;t have to be there. And I left.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you encounter an obstacle, take time to assess the competencies, energy, and passion you would need to overcome it, and then soberly evaluate whether you want to invest your resources in this way. For example, if you discover that success requires knowledge or skills you don&#39;t have and cannot realistically develop in the needed time frame, or when you cannot get the mentoring or advocacy you need to succeed, it may be wiser to walk away. When you deliberately evaluate the obstacles facing you, you will either take on the challenges fully informed, or reallocate your abilities in more suitable environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I will be the first to admit that the steps I describe above are not easy. Turning away from the imposter syndrome and embracing your moxie requires you to re-examine your assumptions, values, and beliefs; risk new behaviors; and commit more to yourself and your growth than you may ever have before. In other words, embracing moxie sets you on a path of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Transformative-Learning-Practice-Community-Workplace/dp/0470257903&quot;>;transformative learning&lt;/a>;, which is rooted in the truism that growth comes from discomfort. As the old man in George Bernard Shaw&#39;s &lt;em>;Back to Methusaleh &lt;/em>;noted&lt;em>;,&lt;/em>; “Life is not meant to be easy, my child, but take courage, for it can be delightful.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 02 Jun 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Areas of Cyber Risk That Boards Need to Address]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/4-areas-of-cyber-risk-that-boards-need-to-address]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_02_947442668.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;PM Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In our technology-dependent society, the effectiveness of cyber risk governance of companies affects its stock prices, as well as short-term and long-term shareholder value. New SEC cybersecurity rules provide a solid basis for transparency. Unfortunately, monitoring the long-term effectiveness of a cyber risk management strategy is not easy to grasp. This article provides four critical areas investors should be informed about for evaluating its long-term effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/4-areas-of-cyber-risk-that-boards-need-to-address?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/4-areas-of-cyber-risk-that-boards-need-to-address?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As technological innovations such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, robotic process automation, and predictive analytics are integrated into organizations, it makes them increasingly susceptible to cyber threats. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyentia.com/wp-content/uploads/IRIS2020_cyentia.pdf&quot;>;Fortune 1000 companies&lt;/a>;, for example, have a 25% probability of being breached, and 10% of them will face multi-million loss. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.house.gov/meetings/SM/SM00/20150422/103276/HHRG-114-SM00-20150422-SD003-U4.pdf&quot;>;smaller companies&lt;/a>;, 60% will be out of business within six months of a severe cyberattack. This means that governing and assessing cyber risks becomes a prerequisite for successful business performance — and that investors need to know how vulnerable companies really are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This need for transparency has been recognized by the regulators and facilitated by the new cyber security rules. Currently, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/sec-is-inching-closer-clarity-cybersecurity-requirements-2023-04-19/&quot;>;has increased its enforcement&lt;/a>; to ensure companies maintain adequate cybersecurity controls and appropriately disclose cyber-related risks and incidents.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, our research shows that cyber risk is not easy to understand. Organizations seem often to &lt;a href=&quot;https://riskcenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WP2017-18_Perceptions-of-Corp-Cyber-RiskInsuracnce-Decisions.pdf&quot;>;underestimate the financial loss&lt;/a>; related to cyber threats. These can include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Immediate effects, such as business interruptions, decreases in production, and delays in product launches, as well as additional costs to recover from an attack.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Long-term consequences, such as damage to the company&#39;s competitiveness and reputational loss, as well as loss of revenues from intellectual property theft, data theft, or unauthorized use of proprietary information.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;There&#39;s also legal risks resulting from neglecting, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act&quot;>;cyber resilience obligations in products and services&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tanium.com/blog/cyber-whistleblowing-is-putting-security-chiefs-in-the-hot-seat/&quot;>;breach reporting&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.law/en/media/international/files/publications/publications/gdpr-enforcement-tracker-report-may-2022?v=1&quot;>;safeguarding of sensitive data&lt;/a>;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2f8456d4-5c60-11eb-b487-01aa75ed71a1/language-en&quot;>;critical infrastructure protection&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;There isn&#39;t a simple way forward, though. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/WEIS_2019_paper_22.pdf&quot;>;Overinvesting in cyber risk management&lt;/a>; or risk-management strategies that don&#39;t align with business needs can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/22d83d19-e7e4-4dcd-a69b-df297e2455fa/content&quot;>;equivalently negative impacts&lt;/a>;. This article explains the importance of the SEC&#39;s new cybersecurity rules and addresses the four essential topics investors should discuss with the board for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of their companies&#39; cyber risk management strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Transparency in Cyber-Risk Governance&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Being transparent about cybersecurity isn&#39;t just best practice, it&#39;s now a requirement for US companies. The SEC&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/is-your-board-prepared-for-new-cybersecurity-regulations&quot;>;new cybersecurity rules&lt;/a>; “require publicly enlisted companies to disclose their cybersecurity governance capabilities, including the board&#39;s oversight of cyber risk, a description of management&#39;s role in assessing and managing cyber risks, the relevant expertise of such management, and management&#39;s role in implementing the company&#39;s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of disclosure allows investors to evaluate the attention of executives and business leaders to cyber risks. Management boards need to understand how these threats can cause material harm. For instance, the ransomware attack on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/ransomware-attack-costs-hanesbrands-100-million-in-lost-sales&quot;>;Hanesbrands&lt;/a>; disrupted order fulfillment for three weeks, causing a $100 million loss in revenue. Another example is the IT outage caused by a cyber attack at &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthitsecurity.com/news/tenet-healthcare-cyberattack-leads-to-100m-in-lost-q2-revenue&quot;>;Tenet Healthcare&lt;/a>;, which also resulted in $100 million of lost revenues. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-10/kaseya-failed-to-address-security-before-hack-ex-employees-say&quot;>;Kaseya VSA breach&lt;/a>; was the result of insecure operational software that ultimately let to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channele2e.com/investors/private-equity/kaseya-private-equity-investor-tpg-pursues-initial-public-offering-ipo/&quot;>;the postponement of an initial public offering&lt;/a>; that sought to raise $875 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;Managing Cyber Risk&quot; dek=&quot;Exploring the challenges and the solutions.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/managing-cyber-risk&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/managing-cyber-risk&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;Managing Cyber Risk&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Exploring the challenges and the solutions. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Under the new SEC guidelines companies are also required to report within four days of incidents that are deemed “material.” The “materiality” determination is influenced by the incident&#39;s impact on the company&#39;s business, operations, and financial conditions. This mandatory incident reporting allows investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the firm&#39;s cyber risk policies and may provide learnings for future improvements in cyber risk management. And there is a significant opportunity for improvement &amp;nbsp;since the cost of cyber crime — including the cost for recovery and remediation — are expected to grow to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/global-rules-crack-down-cybercrime/&quot;>;$10.5 trillion per year by 2025&lt;/a>;.&lt;del>;&lt;/del>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;4 Critical Areas Investors Should Expect Boards to Address&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;These new cybersecurity rules should be considered a starting point for the dialogue about cyber-risk governance. To shore up their cybersecurity and stay ahead of the curve, companies need to consciously anticipate to changing internal and external environment and prioritize their cyber risk efforts accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cyber risk can be hard to understand. Board members already deal with a lot of different strategic challenges, and when faced with issues around cyber risk — such as&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-10/kaseya-failed-to-address-security-before-hack-ex-employees-say?leadSource=uverify%20wall&quot;>;prioritizing product market growth versus its security&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dutchnews.nl/2023/04/court-tells-software-firm-nebu-to-come-clean-about-massive-data-leak/&quot;>;critical supplier dependency for secure service delivery,&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ransomware-tactics-cancer-photos-student-records/&quot;>;dealing with “heinous” aspects of ransomware attacks&lt;/a>;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ukraine-Report-Q1_FINAL.pdf&quot;>;falling victim to geopolitical cyber tensions&lt;/a>; — they can be overwhelmed by the complexity and dynamic nature of the problems. Ultimately, this may cause cybersecurity-related blind spots, impacting the effectiveness of intended decisions and even yielding unintended consequences, which can lead to what is the “capability trap,” an ongoing deterioration of essential organizational processes. An essential characteristic of this trap is that its effects remain hidden from management for a very long time, until it is too late. The capability trap happens more often than many decision-makers imagine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid this trap, companies need to focus on long-term effectiveness of their strategic decisions in four areas:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Align cyber risk management with business needs.&lt;del>;&lt;/del>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Boards have many corporate challenges to face and limited amounts of funding available to meet them, so being able to make the business case for this investment is essential. Clear insights into business, operational, and financial exposures: 1) generate language to discuss cyber risks, 2) connect to board members who do not have a technical background, and 3) &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/is-your-board-prepared-for-new-cybersecurity-regulations&quot;>;put cyber risk on the agenda&lt;/a>;, as well as allow for comparing this risk with other corporate challenges. It also helps the board explain the cyber risk exposure of the firm to investors. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nacdonline.org/services/content.cfm?ItemNumber=73711&quot;>;National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)&lt;/a>; recognizes this need and deployed a commercially available solution to its members.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Continuously monitor the cyber risk capability performance.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The people, processes, and technology that make up firms is changing — and there are more and more areas that need protection, imposing an ever-increasing and dynamically shifting burden on the security capabilities of the organization, making lapses more likely. Solving these problems may require significant security capability improvements, which may take several months or even years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Continuous monitoring is essential to establish if the cyber-risk management strategy performs as intended. Often management reporting dashboards, combined with insights from cyber event exercises are used for this purpose. Currently, in their most advanced form, these activities can capture the near real-time situation. Yet, for bridging the timing gap for utilizing improvements decision-makers have a need to see what the future outcome of their strategic decisions. This evokes the need for simulation aided approaches to strengthen &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e9fbf734-b80c-45a4-ad7e-3ceb9768c07d/content&quot;>;managerial foresight capabilities&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Proactively anticipate to the changing threat landscape.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Digital transformation also allows for faster, stronger, and more sophisticated attacks. This adversarial behavior strengthens the ongoing, changing, and emerging struggle between the offensive and the defensive. Both parties try to observe, learn, and anticipate each other. Consequently, adversaries introduce new, innovative techniques to remain successful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Proactive cyber risk management enables defending organizations to learn from information sharing and exercises prior to cyberattacks. It contributes to security capability improvement prior to attacks and therefore reduces the number of significant security incidents. Reactive learning is significantly costlier because organizational improvement takes place based on the lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents that they have suffered. Currently, 56% of knowledgeable decision-makers make costly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3390/systems10020049&quot;>;suboptimal decisions&lt;/a>; when it comes to cyber risk management. The overspending on cyber risk management affects the profitability of the firm.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Position security as a strategic business enabler.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Cyber-risk-management strategy implementation can be a challenge. As previously mentioned, the ongoing increase in surfaces that require protection and increasing adversarial behavior require more efforts from cybersecurity teams to improve the defensive posture. However, these teams are struggling with a lack of qualified security resources. Currently, the United States alone has more than 750,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html&quot;>;cybersecurity job openings&lt;/a>;. This makes focusing on today&#39;s workload already difficult, let alone preparing for the defense posture of the future by running a cyber risk management program.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Effective ongoing workload reduction becomes essential. Therefore, secure by design, collaboration with other parties, automation, and the realization of economies of scale are critical to achieving a future state of security. Organizations that cannot properly make these adjustments become increasingly exposed to unintended control lapses and reactive learning mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The SEC&#39;s new cybersecurity rules provide a solid basis for transparency about companies cyber-risk governance. These rules are a great basis for starting a dialogue about long-term effectiveness of cyber-risk governance with the board. This article provides four critical areas relevant to this dialogue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Acknowledgements: &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;This work is co-funded by ”Fondo Europeo di Sviluppo Regionale Puglia POR Puglia 2014 – 2020 – Asse I – Obiettivo specifico 1a – Azione 1.1 (RS) – Titolo Progetto: Suite prodotti Cybersecurity e SOC” and BV TECH SpA &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;This work is co-funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cams.mit.edu&quot;>;Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan&lt;/a>; (CAMS).&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The AI Hype Cycle Is Distracting Companies]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/06/the-ai-hype-cycle-is-distracting-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/06/Jun23_02_Skizzomat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Skizzomat&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Machine learning has an &amp;#8220;AI&amp;#8221; problem. With new breathtaking capabilities from generative AI released every several months &amp;#8212; and AI hype escalating at an even higher rate &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s high time we differentiate most of today&amp;#8217;s practical ML projects from those research advances. This begins by correctly naming such projects: Call them &amp;#8220;ML,&amp;#8221; not &amp;#8220;AI.&amp;#8221; Including all ML initiatives under the &amp;#8220;AI&amp;#8221; umbrella oversells and misleads, contributing to a high failure rate for ML business deployments. For most ML projects, the term &amp;#8220;AI&amp;#8221; goes entirely too far &amp;#8212; it alludes to human-level capabilities. In fact, when you unpack the meaning of &amp;#8220;AI,&amp;#8221; you discover just how overblown a buzzword it is: If it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean artificial general intelligence, a grandiose goal for technology, then it just doesn&amp;#8217;t mean anything at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/the-ai-hype-cycle-is-distracting-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/the-ai-hype-cycle-is-distracting-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;You might think that news of “major AI breakthroughs” would do nothing but help machine learning&#39;s (ML) adoption.要是。 Even before the latest splashes — most notably OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT and other generative AI tools — the rich narrative about an emerging, all-powerful AI was already a growing problem for applied ML. That&#39;s because for most ML projects, the buzzword “AI” goes too far. It overly inflates expectations and distracts from the precise way ML will improve business operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most practical use cases of ML — designed to improve the efficiencies of existing business operations — innovate in fairly straightforward ways. Don&#39;t let the glare emanating from this glitzy technology obscure the simplicity of its fundamental duty: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/book/pdf/Predictive_Analytics_by_Eric_Siegel_Excerpts.pdf&quot;>;the purpose of ML is to issue actionable predictions&lt;/a>;, which is why it&#39;s sometimes also called &lt;em>;predictive analytics&lt;/em>;. This means real value, so long as you eschew &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-medias-coverage-of-ai-is-bogus/&quot;>;false hype that &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-medias-coverage-of-ai-is-bogus/&quot;>;it is&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-medias-coverage-of-ai-is-bogus/&quot;>; “highly accurate,”&lt;/a>; like a digital crystal ball.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This capability translates into tangible value in an uncomplicated manner. The predictions drive millions of operational decisions. For example, by predicting which customers are most likely to cancel, a company can provide those customers incentives to stick around. And by predicting which credit card transactions are fraudulent, a card processor can disallow them. It&#39;s practical ML use cases like those that deliver the greatest impact on existing business operations, and the advanced data science methods that such projects apply boil down to ML and only ML.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the problem: Most people conceive of ML as “AI.” This is a reasonable misunderstanding. But “AI” suffers from an unrelenting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aimyths.org/the-term-ai-has-a-clear-meaning&quot;>;incurable case of vagueness&lt;/a>; — it is a catch-all term of art that does not consistently refer to any particular method or value proposition. Calling ML tools “AI” oversells what most ML business deployments actually do. In fact, you couldn&#39;t overpromise more than you do when you call something “AI.” The moniker invokes the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI), software capable of any intellectual task humans can do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This exacerbates a significant problem with ML projects: They often lack a keen focus on their value — exactly how ML will render business processes more effective. As a result, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/01/models-rarely-deployed-industrywide-failure-machine-learning-leadership.html&quot;>;most ML projects fail to deliver value&lt;/a>;. In contrast, ML projects that keep their concrete operational objective front and center stand a good chance of achieving that objective.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Does AI Actually Mean?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“&#39;AI-powered&#39; is tech&#39;s meaningless equivalent of &#39;all natural.&#39;”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;–Devin Coldewey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/ai-powered-is-techs-meaningless-equivalent-of-all-natural/&quot;>;&lt;em>;TechCrunch&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI cannot get away from AGI for two reasons. First, the term “AI” is generally thrown around without clarifying whether we&#39;re talking about AGI or &lt;em>;narrow AI&lt;/em>;, a term that essentially means practical, focused ML deployments. Despite the tremendous differences, the boundary between them blurs in common rhetoric and software sales materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, there&#39;s no satisfactory way to define AI besides AGI. Defining “AI” as something other than AGI has become a research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.machine-ethics.net/podcast/what-is-ai-2/&quot;>;challenge unto itself&lt;/a>;, albeit a quixotic one. If it doesn&#39;t mean AGI, it doesn&#39;t mean anything — other suggested definitions either fail to qualify as “intelligent” in the ambitious spirit implied by “AI” or fail to establish an objective goal. We face this conundrum whether trying to pinpoint 1) a definition for “AI,” 2) the criteria by which a computer would qualify as “intelligent,” or 3) a performance benchmark that would certify true AI. These three are one and the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is with the word “intelligence” itself. When used to describe a machine, it&#39;s relentlessly nebulous. That&#39;s bad news if AI is meant to be a legitimate field. Engineering can&#39;t pursue an imprecise goal. If you can&#39;t define it, you can&#39;t build it. To develop an apparatus, you must be able to measure how good it is — how well it performs and how close you are to the goal — so that you know you&#39;re making progress and so that you ultimately know when you&#39;ve succeeded in developing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a vain attempt to fend off this dilemma, the industry continually performs an awkward dance of AI definitions that I call &lt;em>;the AI shuffle&lt;/em>;. AI means computers that do something smart (a circular definition). No, it&#39;s intelligence demonstrated by machines (even more circular, if that&#39;s possible). Rather, it&#39;s a system that employs certain advanced methodologies, such as ML, natural language processing, rule-based systems, speech recognition, computer vision, or other techniques that operate probabilistically (clearly, employing one or more of these methods doesn&#39;t automatically qualify a system as intelligent).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But surely a machine would qualify as intelligent if it seemed sufficiently humanlike, if you couldn&#39;t distinguish it from a human, say, by interrogating it in a chatroom — the famous &lt;em>;Turing Test.&lt;/em>; But the ability to fool people is an arbitrary, moving target, since human subjects become wiser to the trickery over time. Any given system will only pass the test at most once — fool us twice, shame on humanity. Another reason that passing the Turing Test misses the mark is because there&#39;s limited value or utility in doing so. If AI could exist, certainly it&#39;s supposed to be useful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What if we define AI by what it&#39;s capable of? For example, if we define AI as software that can perform a task so difficult that it traditionally requires a human, such as driving a car, mastering chess, or recognizing human faces. It turns out that this definition doesn&#39;t work either because, once a computer can do something, we tend to trivialized it. After all, computers can manage only mechanical tasks that are well-understood and well-specified. Once surmounted, the accomplishment suddenly loses its charm and the computer that can do it doesn&#39;t seem “intelligent” after all, at least not to the whole-hearted extent intended by the term “AI.” Once computers mastered chess, there was little sentiment that we&#39;d “solved” AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This paradox, known as &lt;em>;The AI Effect&lt;/em>;, tells us that, if it&#39;s possible, it&#39;s not intelligent. Suffering from an ever-elusive objective, AI inadvertently equates to “getting computers to do things too difficult for computers to do” — artificial impossibility. No destination will satisfy once you arrive; AI categorically defies definition. With due irony, the computer science pioneer Larry Tesler famously suggested that we might as well define AI as “whatever machines haven&#39;t done yet.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ironically, it was ML&#39;s measurable success that hyped up AI in the first place. After all, improving measurable performance is &lt;em>;supervised machine learning&lt;/em>; in a nutshell. The feedback from evaluating the system against a benchmark — such as a sample of labeled data — guides its next improvement. By doing so, ML delivers unprecedented value in countless ways. It has earned its title as “the most important general-purpose technology of our era,” as &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/the-business-of-artificial-intelligence&quot;>;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a>; put it. More than anything else, ML&#39;s proven leaps and bounds have fueled AI hype.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;All in with Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;“I predict we will see the third AI Winter within the next five years… When I graduated with my Ph.D. in AI and ML in &#39;91, AI was literally a bad word. No company would consider hiring somebody who was in AI.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;–Usama Fayyad, June 23, 2022, speaking at Machine Learning Week&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is one way to overcome this definition dilemma: Go all in and define AI as AGI, software capable of any intellectual task humans can do. If this science fiction-sounding goal were achieved, I submit that there would be a strong argument that it qualified as “intelligent.” And it&#39;s a measurable goal, at least in principle if not in practicality. For example, its developers could benchmark the system against a set of 1,000,000 tasks, including tens of thousands of complicated email requests you might send to a virtual assistant, various instructions for a warehouse employee you&#39;d just as well issue to a robot, and even brief, one-paragraph overviews for how the machine should, in the role of CEO, run a Fortune 500 company to profitability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AGI may set a clear-cut objective, but it&#39;s out of this world — as unwieldy an ambition as there can be. Nobody knows if and when it could be achieved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therein lies the problem for typical ML projects. By calling them “AI,” we convey that they sit on the same spectrum as AGI, that they&#39;re built on technology that is actively inching along in that direction. “AI” haunts ML. It invokes a grandiose narrative and pumps up expectations, selling real technology in unrealistic terms. This confuses decision-makers and dead-ends projects left and right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s understandable that so many would want to claim a piece of the AI pie, if it&#39;s made of the same ingredients as AGI. The wish fulfillment AGI promises — a kind of ultimate power — is so seductive that it&#39;s nearly irresistible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there&#39;s a better way forward, one that&#39;s realistic and that I would argue is already exciting enough: running major operations — the main things we do as organizations — more effectively! Most commercial ML projects aim to do just that. For them to succeed at a higher rate, we&#39;ve got to come down to earth. If your aim is to deliver operational value, don&#39;t buy “AI” and don&#39;t sell “AI.” Say what you mean and mean what you say. If a technology consists of ML, let&#39;s call it that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reports of the human mind&#39;s looming obsolescence have been greatly exaggerated, which means another era of AI disillusionment is nigh. And, in the long run, we will continue to experience AI winters so long as we continue to hyperbolically apply the term “AI.” But if we tone down the “AI” rhetoric — or otherwise differentiate ML from AI — we will properly insulate ML as an industry from the next AI Winter. This includes resisting the temptation to ride hype waves and refrain from passively affirming starry-eyed decision makers who appear to be bowing at the altar of an all-capable AI. Otherwise, the danger is clear and present: When the hype fades, the overselling is debunked, and winter arrives, much of ML&#39;s true value proposition will be unnecessarily disposed of along with the myths, like the baby with the bathwater.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This article is a product of the author&#39;s work as the Bodily Bicentennial Professor in Analytics at UVA Darden School of Business.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 02 Jun 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Every Modern Enterprise Organization Needs Insight-Driven Marketing - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM MELTWATER]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/06/why-every-modern-enterprise-organization-needs-insight-driven-marketing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-356512&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/04/HBR-Article-1200x675-1.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;If there&#39;s one truth at the center of modern marketing, it&#39;s this one: Brands don&#39;t own the narrative anymore. Consumers do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once formulated around the boardroom table, brand perception is now in consumers&#39; hands as they turn to digital spaces to share their opinions, recommendations, and needs. In turn, the narratives that define brands are created through consumers&#39; conversations with one another, evolving by the second.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when consumers trust their peers most for advice and recommendations, one of the best investments executives can make is in understanding consumers better. This is where insight-driven marketing enters the strategic picture, bringing consumers&#39; needs to the forefront.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Need for Insight-Driven Marketing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumer insights were once rare, based on static data harvested from time-intensive processes like surveys and polls. As billions of new posts are uploaded across the internet each day, organizations have countless opportunities to get to know their customers better. But almost overnight, brands have become overwhelmed with digital sources for much more dynamic insights. Between 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Forrester Consulting&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To stay competitive and relevant, enterprises need advanced means of staying in step with consumer conversations across all channels and markets. This is why insight-driven marketing is so essential.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using Artificial Intelligence, advanced data structuring, and other technology-forward capabilities, insight-driven marketing reveals direction in that chaos.

AI-powered tools such as pattern detection algorithms and digital “assistants” are also enriching marketers&#39; contextual intelligence so they can better predict what will happen next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As AI continues to rapidly advance, there&#39;s never been a better time for organizations to embrace tech-forward solutions. With them, brands are equipped to future-proof their operations with capabilities like trendspotting, viral content forecasting, and predicting campaign returns on investment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Solutions for Enterprise-Level Challenges&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The benefits of insight-driven marketing run parallel to business growth. Brands that do data-driven marketing at scale can increase net sales value by up to 5% and marketing efficiency by up to 20%, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-new-marketing-model-for-growth-how-cpgs-can-crack-the-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/a>;. Still, with added benefits come added responsibilities and increased chances for critical information to fall through the cracks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insight-driven marketing solutions give executives a holistic view of their consumer data sets across key elements of the business, including marketing, public relations, strategy, and research and development. However, all that information loses its potential utility without a system and a team for analyzing and delivering them to key stakeholders and decision makers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With so many potential knowledge dropout points to consider, large businesses require tailored solutions for successful insight-driven marketing.

It points toward a continuation of the current tight labor market, even as the economy cools in response to the Federal Reserve&amp;#8217;s interest rate hikes and the ongoing banking turmoil.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ceos-are-predicting-a-mild-recession-in-the-us?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/ceos-are-predicting-a-mild-recession-in-the-us?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;CEOs continue to send the same message about the US economy: A recession is looming but persistent strength in the labor market will endure. Typically, corporate executives would be focused on cutting costs and jobs amid such uncertain times, but they instead anticipate the job market will stay competitive. The seeming cognitive dissonance underlies the complexity of an economy that has suffered serial shocks in recent years — from the pandemic to inflation to rapid interest rate hikes to a mini banking crisis — but which nonetheless continues to exude signs of resilience.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conference-board.org/topics/CEO-Confidence&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The CEO confidence measure published by the Conference Boar&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;d&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;, where I am chief economist, &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;reveals that for the fourth consecutive quarter the world&#39;s top executives overwhelmingly anticipate a US recession over the next 12 to 18 months. But they expect it will be short and shallow, with limited global spillover. An outsized 87% of CEOs envision this scenario, according to the survey&#39;s second quarter iteration, while only 6% anticipate a deep recession with global spillover, and just 7% expect no recession at all. CEOs&#39; general pessimism continues to weigh on the overall gauge of confidence, which at 43 is little better than the lows achieved during the worst of the pandemic. (The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence is a quarterly survey conducted of nearly 150 CEOs in partnership with The Business Council. Respondents are members of The Business Council and a reading below 50 reflects more negative than positive responses to the survey.)&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;In past quarterly surveys, CEOs indicated that they expected that the Fed&#39;s anti-inflationary efforts would drive this brief and mild US economic downturn. CEOs continue to say they support the central bank&#39;s aggressive rate hikes this quarter, even amid clear expectations of recession and an ongoing banking crisis. Indeed, 82% of CEOs think inflation should be the driving force behind the Fed&#39;s monetary policy decisions. CEOs ranked other influences on Fed policy as being far less important, including the tight labor market (49%), banking stress and the potential for a credit crunch (43%), GDP growth (28%), and debt limit uncertainty (1%). Given that common gauges of consumer inflation hover well above the Fed&#39;s 2% target and the risk of elevated inflation expectations becoming embedded, this view makes sense. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;CEOs appear to be taking the lingering banking crisis in stride, and largely do not view it as likely to trigger a major recession, or even help cause one at all. Asked in the survey about different responses to the crisis, only 28% of CEOs say that they are increasing their own company&#39;s liquidity, and just 17% are altering banking relationships. Most CEOs are “examining relationships” as opposed to taking drastic measures to shield themselves from residual crisis fallout: 62% of CEOs are examining relationships with their banks, 28% are examining their own risk management, 33% are examining their customers&#39; liquidity adequacy, and 30% are examining their suppliers&#39; liquidity adequacy. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;The US economy&#39;s dour outlook notwithstanding, CEOs continue to believe that the labor market will defy expectations and remain largely afloat. Three sets of survey responses support this conclusion: First, only 20% of CEOs intend to reduce their workforce over the next 12 months. A surprising 33% expect to continue hiring and a sizable 46% anticipate no changes in staffing. Second, 75% of CEOs intend to raise wages by 3 percentage points or more over the next year and another 20% plan to raise wages by 1–3 percentage points over the same period. Meanwhile, a total of only 5% either anticipate no changes in wages (4%) or aim to cut wages (1%). Third, and finally, only 9% of CEOs expect no difficulty in hiring qualified workers, meaning 91% expect some or great difficulty.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Labor shortages are the key difference between the outlook today versus prior downturns. Additionally, labor shortages are why CEOs anticipate the recession to be “short and shallow.” Missing workers, strict immigration policy, and, most critically, an aging workforce, are creating an acute shortage in the supply of workers even as demand is likely to ebb in some industries over the course of this year. While workers aged 25 through 64 have largely returned to the labor market post-pandemic, those 65 and older are quickly exiting, creating a dearth of employees with skills and experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This backdrop makes CEOs&#39; responses somewhat easier to interpret, with CEOs falling into one of three camps. In the first camp, a significant share of CEOs are still hiring workers to fill roles vacated by retiring Baby Boomers. Those positions are most prevalent in industries requiring in-person work, including in health care, child- and elder-care, hotels, restaurants, and travel. &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;In the second are the one-fifth of firms signaling layoffs. These are likely among the pandemic darlings that outperformed during the health crisis as demand surged for goods, technology, finance, and housing. They are being forced to right-size amid higher interest rates and as consumers are shifting their demand to services. These less fortunate areas include broad swaths of the tech sector, finance, real estate, construction, and transportation and warehousing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Most CEOs fall into the third camp and expect to make no changes to their workforces, as they anticipate a short and shallow recession, and prefer to hoard labor rather than release workers and rehire them at what will likely be a higher cost.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;This CEO behavior underscores the difficulty firms face in maintaining a skilled workforce even while staring into the maw of another recession. While they face less difficulty than a year ago, most firms still anticipate at least some difficulty hiring talented workers. Moreover, to both attract and retain talent, chief executives continue to view throwing money at the problem (in the form of higher wages and benefits) as the primary solution to this long-term issue. As raising wages and benefits indefinitely is unsustainable, many firms are turning to automation and digital transformation to fill the gap created by the constrained worker supply.&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;So, do CEOs&#39; sentiments regarding recession and the labor force make sense?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;Yes.

But what&#39;s the best way to quantify risks?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A cyber-risk balance sheet is one way of mapping the potential financial impact of cyber events. Creating a balance sheet involves:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Standardization:&lt;/strong>; Selecting a cyber risk quantification framework, for example, by leveraging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairinstitute.org/&quot;>;Factor Analysis of Information Risk&lt;/a>; (FAIR), an international standard quantitative model framework providing operational risk and information security&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Prioritization: &lt;/strong>;Defining an organization&#39;s top cyber threats and quantifying the likelihood of these threats&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Mapping:&lt;/strong>; Connecting the probability of cyber threats to cyber risks in financial terms and associating them with future cyber investments&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;This creates a ledger that can be used by chief information security officers (CISOs) to describe the business case for cybersecurity efforts that show a positive return on investment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How Corporate Boards Should Manage Cyber Risk&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Risk_Corporate_Governance_2021.pdf&quot;>;Principles for Board Governance of Cyber Risk&lt;/a>; introduces six principles for boards to begin with:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Understand that cybersecurity is a strategic business enabler&lt;/strong>;: Enterprises should analyze cybersecurity in the context of strategic implications, as part of enterprise risk.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Understand the economic drivers and impacts of cyber risk&lt;/strong>;: Enterprises should define cyber-risk appetite in financial terms to help inform decision-making.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Align cyber-risk management with business needs&lt;/strong>;: Management should integrate cyber-risk analysis into business decisions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Ensure organizational design supports cybersecurity&lt;/strong>;: Management should ensure the cybersecurity function is represented adequately.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Incorporate cybersecurity expertise into board governance&lt;/strong>;: Regular sessions between management and the board should provide updates on incidents, trends, and vulnerabilities.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Encourage systemic resilience&lt;/strong>;: Board should ensure that management has plans to improve resilience through collaboration with the public sector.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Finding the Right Balance – From a Business Perspective&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Boards need an in-depth understanding of top risks facing the enterprise and should be able to quantify their potential impact. Decisions about cost investments can then be weighed against the potential cost of &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; taking action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By aligning cyber-risk management with business needs, organizations can build a security profile that aligns with the defined risk appetite. This process requires encouraging collaboration between the CISO, the chief technology officer, and chief information officer functions, all of whom should be involved in analyzing each cyber scenario.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through this approach, the board can ask to see real risk reduction. In parallel, security leaders can create allies within business units by helping them reduce the risk of business impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Mapping Out the “Crown Jewels”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The first step in cyber-risk management involves prioritizing where to home in. Organizations can leverage an industry framework like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot;>;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a>; to provide insight into blind spots through consolidated threat visibility. MITRE provides a foundation for security operations teams to develop and map out a framework for detection rules, which are specific to the unique threats and vulnerabilities of an organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frameworks like MITRE make it possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cyberproof.com/blog/creating-a-smarter-soc-with-the-mitre-attck-framework&quot;>;improve threat coverage and response&lt;/a>; by looking at parameters like industry, geolocation, and leadership. With MITRE, organizations can identify which threats, as well as which aspects of the technology landscape, are most likely to lead to damage. By using MITRE to map out key business assets, a customized plan for reducing business risk can be developed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Lowering Costs &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given the impact of the macroeconomic downturn, the biggest question many senior executives are facing is how to maintain effective cybersecurity with more limited resources. That&#39;s where automation and artificial intelligence (AI) come in, as they have the potential to lower the expense of mitigating risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to IBM&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach&quot;>;2022 Cost of a Data Breach&lt;/a>;, organizations deploying AI and automation incurred $3 million less, on average, in breach costs. AI was their biggest cost saver; those deploying AI and automation detected breaches faster, minimizing the impact on operations. Another strategy for cutting costs involves advanced cloud solutions that save dramatically on data ingestion and storage costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Start by Getting the Right Talent &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To pull all of this off, organizations need to have the right talent in place. But that&#39;s easier said than done. To put it simply: There are more cybersecurity jobs than the number of available professionals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2022-WorkForce-Study/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study.ashx&quot;>;According to the (ISC)&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>;&lt;/a>;, the cybersecurity workforce grew to 4.7 million people in 2022, the highest number of workers ever recorded. Yet more than 3.4 million positions still remained open. This is a stark situation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managed Detection and Response (MDR) can address the lack of available talent. MDR providers are outsourced services that can provide organizations with advanced security operations capabilities and work collaboratively with those organizations to remediate threats once they are discovered. They offer access to top professionals who provide input regarding roadmap-related decisions, and who can handle existing, new, and evolving threats. Enterprises find that an advanced MDR service provider makes it possible to do more with less — maintaining scalability while keeping head count down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current climate, MDR providers are increasingly relevant. It&#39;s not just about resources and how to use them, but also about how to build a roadmap moving forward. Shifting focus to evaluate cybersecurity as a business risk — while investing efforts specifically on the threats that pose the greatest danger — can help ensure that an enterprise is poised to detect and respond quickly enough to protect the organization&#39;s key assets. And that&#39;s the real goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the ever-growing threat of cyber attack, business leaders should be thinking about cybersecurity as a strategic business enabler. By illustrating the business case for cybersecurity — aligning cyber-risk management with an organization&#39;s business objectives — it becomes possible to make current and future decisions about the organization&#39;s cyber health in terms that the board can understand.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
